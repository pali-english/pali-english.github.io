Manopubbaṅgamā dhammā,

thus the fool frets.

The fool who thinks they’re a fool  
is wise at least to that extent.

Sajjukhīraṁva muccati;  
Ḍahantaṁ bālamanveti,

Mameva kata maññantu,  
gihī pabbajitā ubho;  
Mamevātivasā assu,  
kiccākiccesu kismici;  
Iti bālassa saṅkappo,  
icchā māno ca vaḍḍhati.  
  
“Let both layfolk and renunciants think  
the work was done by me alone.  
In anything at all that’s to be done,  
let them fall under my sway alone.”  
So thinks the fool,  
their greed and pride only growing.  
    
    Mameva kata maññantu, gihī pabbajitā ubho;
        Mameva: by me alone
        Kata: done
        Maññantu: let them think
        Gihī: layfolk, householders
        Pabbajitā: renunciants, those who have gone forth (from the householder's life)

Aññā hi lābhūpanisā,  
aññā nibbānagāminī;  
Evametaṁ abhiññāya,  
bhikkhu buddhassa sāvako;  
Sakkāraṁ nābhinandeyya,  
vivekamanubrūhaye.  
  
For the means to profit and the path to quenching  
are two quite different things.  
A mendicant disciple of the Buddha,  
understanding what this really means,  
would never delight in honors,  
but rather would foster seclusion.  
  
    Aññā hi lābhūpanisā, aññā nibbānagāminī:
        Aññā: different, another
        Hi: indeed

### 6. Paṇḍitavagga: The Astute

Nidhīnaṁva pavattāraṁ,  
yaṁ passe vajjadassinaṁ;  
Niggayhavādiṁ medhāviṁ,  
tādisaṁ paṇḍitaṁ bhaje;  
Tādisaṁ bhajamānassa,  
seyyo hoti na pāpiyo.  
  
Regard one who sees your faults  
as a guide to a hidden treasure.  
Stay close to one so wise and astute  
who corrects you when you need it.  
Sticking close to such an impartial person,  
things get better, not worse.  
    
Ovadeyyānusāseyya,  
asabbhā ca nivāraye;  
Satañhi so piyo hoti,  
asataṁ hoti appiyo.  
  
Advise and instruct;  
curb wickedness:  
for you shall be loved by the good,  
and disliked by the bad.  
    
Na bhaje pāpake mitte,  
na bhaje purisādhame;  
Bhajetha mitte kalyāṇe,  
bhajetha purisuttame.  
  
Don’t mix with bad friends,  
nor with the worst of men.  
Mix with spiritual friends,  
and with the best of men.  
    
Dhammapīti sukhaṁ seti,  
vippasannena cetasā;  
Ariyappavedite dhamme,  
sadā ramati paṇḍito.  
  
Through joy in the teaching you sleep at ease,  
with clear and confident heart.  
An astute person always delights in the teaching  
proclaimed by the Noble One.  
    
Udakañhi nayanti nettikā,  
Usukārā namayanti tejanaṁ;  
Dāruṁ namayanti tacchakā,  
Attānaṁ damayanti paṇḍitā.  
  
While irrigators guide water,  
fletchers straighten arrows,  
and carpenters carve timber,  
the astute tame themselves.  
    
Selo yathā ekaghano,  
vātena na samīrati;  
Evaṁ nindāpasaṁsāsu,  
na samiñjanti paṇḍitā.  
  
As the wind cannot stir  
a solid mass of rock,  
so too praise and blame  
do not affect the wise.  
    
Yathāpi rahado gambhīro,  
vippasanno anāvilo;  
Evaṁ dhammāni sutvāna,  
vippasīdanti paṇḍitā.  
  
Like a deep lake,  
clear and unclouded,  
so clear are the astute  
when they hear the teachings.  
    
Sabbattha ve sappurisā cajanti,  
Na kāmakāmā lapayanti santo;  
Sukhena phuṭṭhā atha vā dukhena,  
Na uccāvacaṁ paṇḍitā dassayanti.  
  
Good people give up everything,  
they don’t cajole for the things they desire.  
Though touched by sadness or happiness,  
the astute appear neither depressed nor elated.  
    
Na attahetu na parassa hetu,  
Na puttamicche na dhanaṁ na raṭṭhaṁ;  
Na iccheyya adhammena samiddhimattano,  
Sa sīlavā paññavā dhammiko siyā.  
  
Never wish for success by unjust means,  
for your own sake or that of another,  
desiring children, wealth, or nation;  
rather, be virtuous, wise, and just.  
    
Appakā te manussesu,  
ye janā pāragāmino;  
Athāyaṁ itarā pajā,  
tīramevānudhāvati.  
  
Few are those among humans  
who cross to the far shore.  
The rest just run around  
on the near shore.  
    
Ye ca kho sammadakkhāte,  
dhamme dhammānuvattino;  
Te janā pāramessanti,  
maccudheyyaṁ suduttaraṁ.  
  
When the teaching is well explained,  
those who practice accordingly  
will cross over  
Death’s domain so hard to pass.  
    
Kaṇhaṁ dhammaṁ vippahāya,  
Sukkaṁ bhāvetha paṇḍito;  
Okā anokamāgamma,  
Viveke yattha dūramaṁ.  
  
Rid of dark qualities,  
an astute person should develop the bright.  
Leaving home behind  
for the seclusion so hard to enjoy,  
    
Tatrābhiratimiccheyya,  
hitvā kāme akiñcano;  
Pariyodapeyya attānaṁ,  
cittaklesehi paṇḍito.  
  
find delight there,  
having left behind sensual pleasures.  
With no possessions, an astute person  
would cleanse themselves of mental corruptions.  
    
Yesaṁ sambodhiyaṅgesu,  
sammā cittaṁ subhāvitaṁ;  
Ādānapaṭinissagge,  
anupādāya ye ratā;  
Khīṇāsavā jutimanto,  
te loke parinibbutā.  
  
Those whose minds are rightly developed  
in the awakening factors;  
who, letting go of attachments,  
delight in not grasping:  
with defilements ended, brilliant,  
they in this world are quenched.  
  
### 7. Arahantavagga: The Perfected Ones

Gataddhino visokassa,  
vippamuttassa sabbadhi;  
Sabbaganthappahīnassa,  
pariḷāho na vijjati.  
  
At journey’s end, rid of sorrow;  
everywhere free,  
all ties given up,  
no fever is found in them.  
    
Uyyuñjanti satīmanto,  
na nikete ramanti te;  
Haṁsāva pallalaṁ hitvā,  
okamokaṁ jahanti te.  
  
The mindful apply themselves;  
they delight in no abode.  
Like a swan from the marsh that’s gone,  
they leave behind home after home.  
    
Yesaṁ sannicayo natthi,  
ye pariññātabhojanā;  
Suññato animitto ca,  
vimokkho yesaṁ gocaro;  
Ākāseva sakuntānaṁ,  
gati tesaṁ durannayā.  
  
Those with nothing stored up,  
who have understood their food,  
whose domain is the liberation  
of the signless and the empty:  
their path is hard to trace,  
like birds in the sky.  
    


Yassāsavā parikkhīṇā,  
āhāre ca anissito;  
Suññato animitto ca,  
vimokkho yassa gocaro;  
Ākāseva sakuntānaṁ,  
padaṁ tassa durannayaṁ.  
  
One whose defilements have ended;  
who’s not attached to food;  
whose domain is the liberation  
of the signless and the empty:  
their track is hard to trace,  
like birds in the sky.  
  
Yassindriyāni samathaṅgatāni,  
Assā yathā sārathinā sudantā;  
Pahīnamānassa anāsavassa,  
Devāpi tassa pihayanti tādino.  
  
Whose faculties have become serene,  
like horses tamed by a charioteer,  
who has abandoned conceit and defilements;  
the poised one is envied by even the gods.  
  
Pathavisamo no virujjhati,  
Indakhilupamo tādi subbato;  
Rahadova apetakaddamo,  
Saṁsārā na bhavanti tādino.  
  
Undisturbed like the earth,  
true to their vows, steady as a post,  
like a lake clear of mud;  
such a one does not transmigrate.  
  
Santaṁ tassa manaṁ hoti,  
santā vācā ca kamma ca;  
Sammadaññāvimuttassa,  
upasantassa tādino.  
  
Their mind is peaceful,  
peaceful are their speech and deeds.  
Such a one is at peace,  
rightly freed through enlightenment.  
  
Assaddho akataññū ca,  
sandhicchedo ca yo naro;  
Hatāvakāso vantāso,  
sa ve uttamaporiso.  
  
Lacking faith, a house-breaker,  
one who acknowledges nothing,  
purged of hope, they’ve wasted their chance:  
that is indeed the supreme person!  
  
Gāme vā yadi vāraññe,  
Ninne vā yadi vā thale;  
Yattha arahanto viharanti,  
Taṁ bhūmirāmaṇeyyakaṁ.  
  
Whether in village or wilderness,  
in a valley or the uplands,  
wherever the perfected ones live  
is a delightful place.  
  
Ramaṇīyāni araññāni,  
yattha na ramatī jano;  
Vītarāgā ramissanti,  
na te kāmagavesino.  
  
Delightful are the wildernesses  
where no people delight.  
Those free of greed will delight there,  
not those who seek sensual pleasures.  

### 8. Sahassavagga: The Thousands

Sahassamapi ce vācā,  
anatthapadasaṁhitā;  
Ekaṁ atthapadaṁ seyyo,  
yaṁ sutvā upasammati.  
  
Better than a thousand  
meaningless sayings  
is a single meaningful saying,  
hearing which brings you peace.  
  
Sahassamapi ce gāthā,  
anatthapadasaṁhitā;  
Ekaṁ gāthāpadaṁ seyyo,  
yaṁ sutvā upasammati.  
  
Better than a thousand  
meaningless verses  
is a single meaningful verse,  
hearing which brings you peace.  
  
Yo ca gāthā sataṁ bhāse,  
anatthapadasaṁhitā;  
Ekaṁ dhammapadaṁ seyyo,  
yaṁ sutvā upasammati.  
  
Better than reciting  
a hundred meaningless verses  
is a single saying of Dhamma,  
hearing which brings you peace.  
  
Yo sahassaṁ sahassena,  
saṅgāme mānuse jine;  
Ekañca jeyyamattānaṁ,  
sa ve saṅgāmajuttamo.  
  
The supreme conqueror is  
not he who conquers a million men in battle,  
but he who conquers a single man:  
himself.  
  
Attā have jitaṁ seyyo,  
yā cāyaṁ itarā pajā;  
Attadantassa posassa,  
niccaṁ saññatacārino.  
  
It is surely better to conquer oneself  
than all those other folk.  
When a person has tamed themselves,  
always living restrained,  
  
Neva devo na gandhabbo,  
na māro saha brahmunā;  
Jitaṁ apajitaṁ kayirā,  
tathārūpassa jantuno.  
  
no god nor fairy,  
nor Māra nor Brahmā,  
can undo the victory  
of such a one.  
  
Māse māse sahassena,  
yo yajetha sataṁ samaṁ;  
Ekañca bhāvitattānaṁ,  
muhuttamapi pūjaye;  
Sāyeva pūjanā seyyo,  
yañce vassasataṁ hutaṁ.  
  
Rather than a thousand-fold sacrifice,  
every month for a hundred years,  
it’s better to honor for a single moment  
one who has developed themselves.  
That offering is better  
than the hundred year sacrifice.  
  
Yo ca vassasataṁ jantu,  
aggiṁ paricare vane;  
Ekañca bhāvitattānaṁ,  
muhuttamapi pūjaye;  
Sāyeva pūjanā seyyo,  
yañce vassasataṁ hutaṁ.  
  
Rather than serve the sacred flame  
in the forest for a hundred years,  
it’s better to honor for a single moment  
one who has developed themselves.  
That offering is better  
than the hundred year sacrifice.  
  
Yaṁ kiñci yiṭṭhaṁ va hutaṁ va loke,  
Saṁvaccharaṁ yajetha puññapekkho;  
Sabbampi taṁ na catubhāgameti,  
Abhivādanā ujjugatesu seyyo.  
  
Whatever sacrifice or offering in the world  
a seeker of merit may make for a year,  
none of it is worth a quarter  
of bowing to the upright.  
  
Abhivādanasīlissa,  
niccaṁ vuḍḍhāpacāyino;  
Cattāro dhammā vaḍḍhanti,  
āyu vaṇṇo sukhaṁ balaṁ.  
  
For one in the habit of bowing,  
always honoring the elders,  
four blessings grow:  
lifespan, beauty, happiness, and strength.  
  
Yo ca vassasataṁ jīve,  
dussīlo asamāhito;  
Ekāhaṁ jīvitaṁ seyyo,  
sīlavantassa jhāyino.  
  
Better to live a single day  
ethical and absorbed in meditation  
than to live a hundred years  
unethical and lacking immersion.  
  
Yo ca vassasataṁ jīve,  
duppañño asamāhito;  
Ekāhaṁ jīvitaṁ seyyo,  
paññavantassa jhāyino.  
  
Better to live a single day  
wise and absorbed in meditation  
than to live a hundred years  
witless and lacking immersion.  
  
Yo ca vassasataṁ jīve,  
kusīto hīnavīriyo;  
Ekāhaṁ jīvitaṁ seyyo,  
vīriyamārabhato daḷhaṁ.  
  
Better to live a single day  
energetic and strong,  
than to live a hundred years  
lazy and lacking energy.  
  
Yo ca vassasataṁ jīve,  
apassaṁ udayabbayaṁ;  
Ekāhaṁ jīvitaṁ seyyo,  
passato udayabbayaṁ.  
  
Better to live a single day  
seeing rise and fall  
than to live a hundred years  
blind to rise and fall.  
  
Yo ca vassasataṁ jīve,  
apassaṁ amataṁ padaṁ;  
Ekāhaṁ jīvitaṁ seyyo,  
passato amataṁ padaṁ.  
  
Better to live a single day  
seeing the deathless state  
than to live a hundred years  
blind to the deathless state.  
  
Yo ca vassasataṁ jīve,  
apassaṁ dhammamuttamaṁ;  
Ekāhaṁ jīvitaṁ seyyo,  
passato dhammamuttamaṁ.  
Sahassavaggo aṭṭhamo.  
  
Better to live a single day  
seeing the supreme teaching  
than to live a hundred years  
blind to the supreme teaching.  

### 9. Pāpavagga: Wickedness

Abhittharetha kalyāṇe,  
pāpā cittaṁ nivāraye;  
Dandhañhi karoto puññaṁ,  
pāpasmiṁ ramatī mano.  
  
Rush to do good,  
shield your mind from evil;  
for when you’re slow to do good,  
your thoughts delight in wickedness.  
  
Pāpañce puriso kayirā,  
Na naṁ kayirā punappunaṁ;  
Na tamhi chandaṁ kayirātha,  
Dukkho pāpassa uccayo.  
  
If you do something bad,  
don’t do it again and again,  
don’t set your heart on it,  
for piling up evil is suffering.  
  
Puññañce puriso kayirā,  
kayirā naṁ punappunaṁ;  
Tamhi chandaṁ kayirātha,  
sukho puññassa uccayo.  
  
If you do something good,  
do it again and again,  
set your heart on it,  
for piling up goodness is joyful.  
  
Pāpopi passati bhadraṁ,  
Yāva pāpaṁ na paccati;  
Yadā ca paccati pāpaṁ,  
Atha pāpo pāpāni passati.  
  
Even the wicked see good things,  
so long as their wickedness has not ripened.  
But as soon as that wickedness ripens,  
then the wicked see wicked things.  
  
Bhadropi passati pāpaṁ,  
Yāva bhadraṁ na paccati;  
Yadā ca paccati bhadraṁ,  
Atha bhadro bhadrāni passati.  
  
Even the good see wicked things,  
so long as their goodness has not ripened.  
But as soon as that goodness ripens,  
then the good see good things.  
  
Māvamaññetha pāpassa,  
na mantaṁ āgamissati;  
Udabindunipātena,  
udakumbhopi pūrati;  
Bālo pūrati pāpassa,  
thokaṁ thokampi ācinaṁ.  
  
Think not lightly of evil,  
that it won’t come back to you.  
The pot is filled with water  
falling drop by drop;  
the fool is filled with wickedness  
piled up bit by bit.  
  
Māvamaññetha puññassa,  
na mandaṁ āgamissati;  
Udabindunipātena,  
udakumbhopi pūrati;  
Dhīro pūrati puññassa,  
thokaṁ thokampi ācinaṁ.  
  
Think not lightly of goodness,  
that it won’t come back to you.  
The pot is filled with water  
falling drop by drop;  
the sage is filled with goodness  
piled up bit by bit.  
  
Vāṇijova bhayaṁ maggaṁ,  
appasattho mahaddhano;  
Visaṁ jīvitukāmova,  
pāpāni parivajjaye.  
  
Avoid wickedness,  
as a merchant with rich cargo and small escort  
would avoid a dangerous road,  
or one who loves life would avoid drinking poison.  
  
Pāṇimhi ce vaṇo nāssa,  
hareyya pāṇinā visaṁ;  
Nābbaṇaṁ visamanveti,  
natthi pāpaṁ akubbato.  
  
You can carry poison in your hand  
if it has no wound,  
for poison does not infect without a wound;  
nothing bad happens unless you do bad.  
  
Yo appaduṭṭhassa narassa dussati,  
Suddhassa posassa anaṅgaṇassa;  
Tameva bālaṁ pacceti pāpaṁ,  
Sukhumo rajo paṭivātaṁva khitto.  
  
Whoever wrongs a man who has done no wrong,  
a pure man who has not a blemish,  
the evil backfires on the fool,  
like fine dust thrown upwind.  
  
Gabbhameke uppajjanti,  
nirayaṁ pāpakammino;  
Saggaṁ sugatino yanti,  
parinibbanti anāsavā.  
  
Some are born in a womb;  
evil-doers go to hell;  
the virtuous go to heaven;  
the stainless are extinguished.  
  
Na antalikkhe na samuddamajjhe,  
Na pabbatānaṁ vivaraṁ pavissa;  
Na vijjatī so jagatippadeso,  
Yatthaṭṭhito mucceyya pāpakammā.  
  
Not in the sky, nor mid-ocean,  
nor hiding in a mountain cleft;  
you’ll find no place in the world  
to escape your wicked deeds.  
  
Na antalikkhe na samuddamajjhe,  
Na pabbatānaṁ vivaraṁ pavissa;  
Na vijjatī so jagatippadeso,  
Yatthaṭṭhitaṁ nappasaheyya maccu.  
  
Not in the sky, nor mid-ocean,  
nor hiding in a mountain cleft;  
you’ll find no place in the world  
where you won’t be vanquished by death.  

### 10. Daṇḍavagga: The Rod

Sabbe tasanti daṇḍassa,  
sabbe bhāyanti maccuno;  
Attānaṁ upamaṁ katvā,  
na haneyya na ghātaye.  
  
All tremble at the rod,  
all fear death.  
Treating others like oneself,  
neither kill nor incite to kill.  
  
Sabbe tasanti daṇḍassa,  
sabbesaṁ jīvitaṁ piyaṁ;  
Attānaṁ upamaṁ katvā,  
na haneyya na ghātaye.  
  
All tremble at the rod,  
all love life.  
Treating others like oneself,  
neither kill nor incite to kill.  
  
Sukhakāmāni bhūtāni,  
yo daṇḍena vihiṁsati;  
Attano sukhamesāno,  
pecca so na labhate sukhaṁ.  
  
Creatures love happiness,  
so if you harm them with a stick  
in search of your own happiness,  
after death you won’t find happiness.  
  
Sukhakāmāni bhūtāni,  
yo daṇḍena na hiṁsati;  
Attano sukhamesāno,  
pecca so labhate sukhaṁ.  
  
Creatures love happiness,  
so if you don’t hurt them with a stick  
in search of your own happiness,  
after death you will find happiness.  
  
Māvoca pharusaṁ kañci,  
vuttā paṭivadeyyu taṁ;  
Dukkhā hi sārambhakathā,  
paṭidaṇḍā phuseyyu taṁ.  
  
Don’t speak harshly,  
they may speak harshly back.  
For aggressive speech is painful,  
and the rod may spring back on you.  
  
Sace neresi attānaṁ,  
kaṁso upahato yathā;  
Esa pattosi nibbānaṁ,  
sārambho te na vijjati.  
  
If you still yourself  
like a broken gong,  
you’re quenched  
and conflict-free.  
  
Yathā daṇḍena gopālo,  
gāvo pājeti gocaraṁ;  
Evaṁ jarā ca maccu ca,  
āyuṁ pājenti pāṇinaṁ.  
  
As a cowherd drives the cows  
to pasture with the rod,  
so too old age and death  
drive life from living beings.  
  
Atha pāpāni kammāni,  
karaṁ bālo na bujjhati;  
Sehi kammehi dummedho,  
aggidaḍḍhova tappati.  
  
The fool does not understand  
the evil that they do.  
But because of those deeds, that dullard  
is tormented as if burnt by fire.  
  
Yo daṇḍena adaṇḍesu,  
appaduṭṭhesu dussati;  
Dasannamaññataraṁ ṭhānaṁ,  
khippameva nigacchati.  
  
One who violently attacks  
the peaceful and the innocent  
swiftly falls  
to one of ten bad states:  
  
Vedanaṁ pharusaṁ jāniṁ,  
sarīrassa va bhedanaṁ;  
Garukaṁ vāpi ābādhaṁ,  
cittakkhepaṁ va pāpuṇe.  
  
harsh pain; loss;  
the breakup of the body;  
serious illness;  
mental distress;  
  
Rājato vā upasaggaṁ,  
Abbhakkhānaṁ va dāruṇaṁ;  
Parikkhayaṁ va ñātīnaṁ,  
Bhogānaṁ va pabhaṅguraṁ.  
  
hazards from rulers;  
vicious slander;  
loss of kin;  
destruction of wealth;  
  
Atha vāssa agārāni,  
aggi ḍahati pāvako;  
Kāyassa bhedā duppañño,  
nirayaṁ sopapajjati.  
  
or else their home  
is consumed by fire.  
When their body breaks up, that witless person  
is reborn in hell.  
  
Na naggacariyā na jaṭā na paṅkā,  
Nānāsakā thaṇḍilasāyikā vā;  
Rajojallaṁ ukkuṭikappadhānaṁ,  
Sodhenti maccaṁ avitiṇṇakaṅkhaṁ.  
  
Not nakedness, nor matted hair, nor mud,  
nor fasting, nor lying on bare ground,  
nor wearing dust and dirt, or squatting on the heels,  
will cleanse a mortal not free of doubt.  
  
Alaṅkato cepi samaṁ careyya,  
Santo danto niyato brahmacārī;  
Sabbesu bhūtesu nidhāya daṇḍaṁ,  
So brāhmaṇo so samaṇo sa bhikkhu.  
  
Dressed-up they may be, but if they live well—  
peaceful, tamed, committed to the spiritual path,  
having laid aside violence towards all creatures—  
they are a brahmin, an ascetic, a mendicant.  
  
Hirīnisedho puriso,  
koci lokasmi vijjati;  
Yo niddaṁ apabodheti,  
asso bhadro kasāmiva.  
  
Can a person constrained by conscience  
be found in the world?  
Who shies away from blame,  
like a fine horse from the whip?  
  
Asso yathā bhadro kasāniviṭṭho,  
Ātāpino saṁvegino bhavātha;  
Saddhāya sīlena ca vīriyena ca,  
Samādhinā dhammavinicchayena ca;  
Sampannavijjācaraṇā patissatā,  
Jahissatha dukkhamidaṁ anappakaṁ.  
  
Like a fine horse under the whip,  
be keen and full of urgency.  
With faith, ethics, and energy,  
immersion, and investigation of principles,  
accomplished in knowledge and conduct, mindful,  
give up this vast suffering.  
  
Udakañhi nayanti nettikā,  
Usukārā namayanti tejanaṁ;  
Dāruṁ namayanti tacchakā,  
Attānaṁ damayanti subbatā.  
  
While irrigators guide water,  
fletchers shape arrows,  
and carpenters carve timber—  
those true to their vows tame themselves.  

### 11. Jarāvagga: Old Age

Ko nu hāso kimānando,  
niccaṁ pajjalite sati;  
Andhakārena onaddhā,  
padīpaṁ na gavesatha.  
  
What is joy, what is laughter,  
when the flames are ever burning?  
Shrouded by darkness,  
would you not seek a light?  
  
Passa cittakataṁ bimbaṁ,  
arukāyaṁ samussitaṁ;  
Āturaṁ bahusaṅkappaṁ,  
yassa natthi dhuvaṁ ṭhiti.  
  
See this fancy puppet,  
a body built of sores,  
diseased, obsessed over,  
in which nothing lasts at all.  
  
Parijiṇṇamidaṁ rūpaṁ,  
roganīḷaṁ pabhaṅguraṁ;  
Bhijjati pūtisandeho,  
maraṇantañhi jīvitaṁ.  
  
This body is decrepit and frail,  
a nest of disease.  
This foul carcass falls apart,  
for life ends only in death.  
  
Yānimāni apatthāni,  
alābūneva sārade;  
Kāpotakāni aṭṭhīni,  
tāni disvāna kā rati.  
  
These dove-grey bones  
are tossed away like  
dried gourds in the autumn—  
what joy is there in such a sight?  
  
Aṭṭhīnaṁ nagaraṁ kataṁ,  
maṁsalohitalepanaṁ;  
Yattha jarā ca maccu ca,  
māno makkho ca ohito.  
  
In this city built of bones,  
plastered with flesh and blood,  
old age and death are stashed away,  
along with conceit and contempt.  
  
Jīranti ve rājarathā sucittā,  
Atho sarīrampi jaraṁ upeti;  
Satañca dhammo na jaraṁ upeti,  
Santo have sabbhi pavedayanti.  
  
Fancy chariots of kings wear out,  
and even this body gets old.  
But the teaching of the good never gets old;  
so the true and the good proclaim.  
  
Appassutāyaṁ puriso,  
balībaddhova jīrati;  
Maṁsāni tassa vaḍḍhanti,  
paññā tassa na vaḍḍhati.  
  
A person of little learning  
ages like an ox—  
their flesh grows,  
but not their wisdom.  
  
Anekajātisaṁsāraṁ,  
sandhāvissaṁ anibbisaṁ;  
Gahakāraṁ gavesanto,  
dukkhā jāti punappunaṁ.  
  
Transmigrating through countless rebirths,  
I’ve journeyed without reward,  
searching for the house-builder;  
painful is birth again and again.  
  
Gahakāraka diṭṭhosi,  
puna gehaṁ na kāhasi;  
Sabbā te phāsukā bhaggā,  
gahakūṭaṁ visaṅkhataṁ;  
Visaṅkhāragataṁ cittaṁ,  
taṇhānaṁ khayamajjhagā.  
  
I’ve seen you, house-builder!  
You won’t build a house again!  
Your rafters are all broken,  
your roof-peak is demolished.  
My mind, set on demolition,  
has reached the end of craving.  
  
Acaritvā brahmacariyaṁ,  
aladdhā yobbane dhanaṁ;  
Jiṇṇakoñcāva jhāyanti,  
khīṇamaccheva pallale.  
  
When young they spurned the spiritual path  
and failed to earn any wealth.  
Now they languish like old cranes  
in a pond bereft of fish.  
  
Acaritvā brahmacariyaṁ,  
aladdhā yobbane dhanaṁ;  
Senti cāpātikhīṇāva,  
purāṇāni anutthunaṁ.  
  
When young they spurned the spiritual path  
and failed to earn any wealth.  
Now they lie like spent arrows,  
bemoaning over things past.  

### 12. Attavagga: The Self

Attānañce piyaṁ jaññā,  
rakkheyya naṁ surakkhitaṁ;  
Tiṇṇaṁ aññataraṁ yāmaṁ,  
paṭijaggeyya paṇḍito.  
  
If you’d only love yourself,  
you’d look after yourself right well.  
In one of the night’s three watches,  
an astute person would remain alert.  
  
Attānameva paṭhamaṁ,  
patirūpe nivesaye;  
Athaññamanusāseyya,  
na kilisseyya paṇḍito.  
  
The astute would avoid being corrupted  
by grounding themselves first of all  
in what is suitable,  
and only then instructing others.  
  
Attānañce tathā kayirā,  
yathāññamanusāsati;  
Sudanto vata dametha,  
attā hi kira duddamo.  
  
If one so acts  
as one instructs,  
the well-tamed would tame others,  
for the self is hard to tame, they say.  
  
Attā hi attano nātho,  
ko hi nātho paro siyā;  
Attanā hi sudantena,  
nāthaṁ labhati dullabhaṁ.  
  
Self is indeed the lord of self,  
for who else would be one’s lord?  
When one’s self is well-tamed,  
one gains a lord that’s rare indeed.  
  
Attanā hi kataṁ pāpaṁ,  
Attajaṁ attasambhavaṁ;  
Abhimatthati dummedhaṁ,  
Vajiraṁvasmamayaṁ maṇiṁ.  
  
For the evil that one does,  
born and produced in oneself,  
grinds down a fool,  
as diamond grinds a lesser gem.  
  
Yassa accantadussilyaṁ,  
māluvā sālamivotthataṁ;  
Karoti so tathattānaṁ,  
yathā naṁ icchatī diso.  
  
One choked by immorality,  
as a sal tree by a creeper,  
does to themselves  
what a foe only wishes.  
  
Sukarāni asādhūni,  
attano ahitāni ca;  
Yaṁ ve hitañca sādhuñca,  
taṁ ve paramadukkaraṁ.  
  
It’s easy to do bad things  
harmful to oneself,  
but good things that are helpful  
are the hardest things to do.  
  
Yo sāsanaṁ arahataṁ,  
ariyānaṁ dhammajīvinaṁ;  
Paṭikkosati dummedho,  
diṭṭhiṁ nissāya pāpikaṁ;  
Phalāni kaṭṭhakasseva,  
attaghātāya phallati.  
  
On account of wicked views—  
scorning the guidance  
of the perfected ones,  
the noble ones living righteously—  
the idiot begets their own demise,  
like the bamboo bearing fruit.  
  
Attanā hi kataṁ pāpaṁ,  
attanā saṅkilissati;  
Attanā akataṁ pāpaṁ,  
attanāva visujjhati;  
Suddhī asuddhi paccattaṁ,  
nāñño aññaṁ visodhaye.  
  
For it is by oneself that evil’s done,  
one is corrupted by oneself.  
It’s by oneself that evil’s not done,  
one is purified by oneself.  
Purity and impurity are personal matters,  
no one can purify another.  
  
Attadatthaṁ paratthena,  
bahunāpi na hāpaye;  
Attadatthamabhiññāya,  
sadatthapasuto siyā.  
Attavaggo dvādasamo.  
  
Never neglect your own good  
for the sake of another, however great.  
Knowing well what’s good for you,  
be intent upon your true goal.  

### 13. Lokavagga: The World

Hīnaṁ dhammaṁ na seveyya,  
pamādena na saṁvase;  
Micchādiṭṭhiṁ na seveyya,  
na siyā lokavaḍḍhano.  
  
Don’t resort to lowly things,  
don’t abide in negligence,  
don’t resort to wrong views,  
don’t perpetuate the world.  
  
Uttiṭṭhe nappamajjeyya,  
dhammaṁ sucaritaṁ care;  
Dhammacārī sukhaṁ seti,  
asmiṁ loke paramhi ca.  
  
Get up, don’t be heedless,  
live by principle, with good conduct.  
For one of good conduct sleeps at ease,  
in this world and the next.  
  
Dhammaṁ care sucaritaṁ,  
na naṁ duccaritaṁ care;  
Dhammacārī sukhaṁ seti,  
asmiṁ loke paramhi ca.  
  
Live by principle, with good conduct,  
don’t conduct yourself badly.  
For one of good conduct sleeps at ease,  
in this world and the next.  
  
Yathā pubbuḷakaṁ passe,  
yathā passe marīcikaṁ;  
Evaṁ lokaṁ avekkhantaṁ,  
maccurājā na passati.  
  
Look upon the world  
as a bubble  
or a mirage,  
then the King of Death won’t see you.  
  
Etha passathimaṁ lokaṁ,  
cittaṁ rājarathūpamaṁ;  
Yattha bālā visīdanti,  
natthi saṅgo vijānataṁ.  
  
Come, see this world decked out  
like a fancy royal chariot.  
Here fools flounder,  
but the discerning are not chained.  
  
Yo ca pubbe pamajjitvā,  
pacchā so nappamajjati;  
Somaṁ lokaṁ pabhāseti,  
abbhā muttova candimā.  
  
He who once was heedless,  
but turned to heedfulness,  
lights up the world  
like the moon freed from clouds.  
  
Yassa pāpaṁ kataṁ kammaṁ,  
kusalena pidhīyati;  
Somaṁ lokaṁ pabhāseti,  
abbhā muttova candimā.  
  
Someone whose bad deed  
is supplanted by the good,  
lights up the world,  
like the moon freed from clouds.  
  
Andhabhūto ayaṁ loko,  
tanukettha vipassati;  
Sakuṇo jālamuttova,  
appo saggāya gacchati.  
  
Blind is the world,  
few are those who clearly see.  
Only a handful go to heaven,  
like a bird freed from a net.  
  
Haṁsādiccapathe yanti,  
ākāse yanti iddhiyā;  
Nīyanti dhīrā lokamhā,  
jetvā māraṁ savāhiniṁ.  
  
Swans fly by the sun’s path,  
psychic sages fly through space.  
The wise leave the world,  
having vanquished Māra and his mount.  
  
Ekaṁ dhammaṁ atītassa,  
musāvādissa jantuno;  
Vitiṇṇaparalokassa,  
natthi pāpaṁ akāriyaṁ.  
  
When a person, spurning the hereafter,  
transgresses in just one thing—  
lying—  
there is no evil they would not do.  
  
Na ve kadariyā devalokaṁ vajanti,  
Bālā have nappasaṁsanti dānaṁ;  
Dhīro ca dānaṁ anumodamāno,  
Teneva so hoti sukhī parattha.  
  
The miserly don’t ascend to heaven,  
it takes a fool to not praise giving.  
The wise celebrate giving,  
and so find happiness in the hereafter.  
  
Pathabyā ekarajjena,  
saggassa gamanena vā;  
Sabbalokādhipaccena,  
sotāpattiphalaṁ varaṁ.  
Lokavaggo terasamo.  
  
The fruit of stream-entry is better  
than being the one king of the earth,  
than going to heaven,  
than lordship over all the world.  

### 14. Buddhavagga: The Buddhas

Yassa jitaṁ nāvajīyati,  
Jitaṁ yassa noyāti koci loke;  
Taṁ buddhamanantagocaraṁ,  
Apadaṁ kena padena nessatha.  
  
He whose victory may not be undone,  
a victory unrivaled in all the world;  
by what track would you trace that Buddha,  
who leaves no track in his infinite range?  
  
Yassa jālinī visattikā,  
Taṇhā natthi kuhiñci netave;  
Taṁ buddhamanantagocaraṁ,  
Apadaṁ kena padena nessatha.  
  
Of craving, the weaver, the clinger, he has none:  
so where can he be traced?  
By what track would you trace that Buddha,  
who leaves no track in his infinite range?  
  
Ye jhānapasutā dhīrā,  
nekkhammūpasame ratā;  
Devāpi tesaṁ pihayanti,  
sambuddhānaṁ satīmataṁ.  
  
The wise intent on absorption,  
who love the peace of renunciation,  
the Buddhas, ever mindful,  
are envied by even the gods.  
  
Kiccho manussapaṭilābho,  
kicchaṁ maccāna jīvitaṁ;  
Kicchaṁ saddhammassavanaṁ,  
kiccho buddhānamuppādo.  
  
It’s hard to gain a human birth;  
the life of mortals is hard;  
it’s hard to hear the true teaching;  
the arising of Buddhas is hard.  
  
Sabbapāpassa akaraṇaṁ,  
kusalassa upasampadā;  
Sacittapariyodapanaṁ,  
etaṁ buddhāna sāsanaṁ.  
  
Not to do any evil;  
to embrace the good;  
to purify one’s mind:  
this is the instruction of the Buddhas.  
  
Khantī paramaṁ tapo titikkhā,  
Nibbānaṁ paramaṁ vadanti buddhā;  
Na hi pabbajito parūpaghātī,  
Na samaṇo hoti paraṁ viheṭhayanto.  
  
Patient acceptance is the ultimate austerity.  
Extinguishment is the ultimate, say the Buddhas.  
No true renunciate injures another,  
nor does an ascetic hurt another.  
  
Anūpavādo anūpaghāto,  
Pātimokkhe ca saṁvaro;  
Mattaññutā ca bhattasmiṁ,  
Pantañca sayanāsanaṁ;  
Adhicitte ca āyogo,  
Etaṁ buddhāna sāsanaṁ.  
  
Not speaking ill nor doing harm;  
restraint in the monastic code;  
moderation in eating;  
staying in remote lodgings;  
commitment to the higher mind—  
this is the instruction of the Buddhas.  
  
Na kahāpaṇavassena,  
titti kāmesu vijjati;  
Appassādā dukhā kāmā,  
iti viññāya paṇḍito.  
  
Even if it were raining money,  
you’d not be sated in sensual pleasures.  
An astute person understands that sensual pleasures  
offer little gratification and much suffering.  
  
Api dibbesu kāmesu,  
ratiṁ so nādhigacchati;  
Taṇhakkhayarato hoti,  
sammāsambuddhasāvako.  
  
Thus they find no delight  
even in celestial pleasures.  
A disciple of the fully awakened Buddha  
delights in the ending of craving.  
  
Bahuṁ ve saraṇaṁ yanti,  
pabbatāni vanāni ca;  
Ārāmarukkhacetyāni,  
manussā bhayatajjitā.  
  
So many go for refuge  
to mountains and forest groves,  
to tree shrines in tended parks;  
those people are driven by fear.  
  
Netaṁ kho saraṇaṁ khemaṁ,  
netaṁ saraṇamuttamaṁ;  
Netaṁ saraṇamāgamma,  
sabbadukkhā pamuccati.  
  
But such refuge is no sanctuary,  
it is no supreme refuge.  
By going to that refuge,  
you’re not released from suffering.  
  
Yo ca buddhañca dhammañca,  
saṅghañca saraṇaṁ gato;  
Cattāri ariyasaccāni,  
sammappaññāya passati.  
  
One gone for refuge to the Buddha,  
to his teaching and to the Saṅgha,  
sees the four noble truths  
with right understanding:  
  
Dukkhaṁ dukkhasamuppādaṁ,  
dukkhassa ca atikkamaṁ;  
Ariyaṁ caṭṭhaṅgikaṁ maggaṁ,  
dukkhūpasamagāminaṁ.  
  
suffering, suffering’s origin,  
suffering’s transcendence,  
and the noble eightfold path  
that leads to the stilling of suffering.  
  
Etaṁ kho saraṇaṁ khemaṁ,  
etaṁ saraṇamuttamaṁ;  
Etaṁ saraṇamāgamma,  
sabbadukkhā pamuccati.  
  
Such refuge is a sanctuary,  
it is the supreme refuge.  
By going to that refuge,  
you’re released from all suffering.  
  
Dullabho purisājañño,  
na so sabbattha jāyati;  
Yattha so jāyati dhīro,  
taṁ kulaṁ sukhamedhati.  
  
It’s hard to find a thoroughbred man  
they’re not born just anywhere.  
A family where that sage is born  
prospers in happiness.  
  
Sukho buddhānamuppādo,  
sukhā saddhammadesanā;  
Sukhā saṅghassa sāmaggī,  
samaggānaṁ tapo sukho.  
  
Happy, the arising of Buddhas!  
Happy, the teaching of Dhamma!  
Happy is the harmony of the Saṅgha,  
and the striving of the harmonious is happy.  
  
Pūjārahe pūjayato,  
buddhe yadi va sāvake;  
Papañcasamatikkante,  
tiṇṇasokapariddave.  
  
When a person venerates the worthy—  
the Buddha or his disciple,  
who have transcended proliferation,  
and have left behind grief and lamentation,  
  
Te tādise pūjayato,  
nibbute akutobhaye;  
Na sakkā puññaṁ saṅkhātuṁ,  
imettamapi kenaci.  
  
quenched, fearing nothing from any quarter—  
the merit of one venerating such as these,  
cannot be calculated by anyone,  
saying it is just this much.  

### 15. Sukhavagga: Happiness

Susukhaṁ vata jīvāma,  
verinesu averino;  
Verinesu manussesu,  
viharāma averino.  
  
Let us live so very happily,  
loving among the hostile.  
Among hostile people,  
let us live with love.  
  
Susukhaṁ vata jīvāma,  
āturesu anāturā;  
Āturesu manussesu,  
viharāma anāturā.  
  
Let us live so very happily,  
healthy among the ailing.  
Among ailing people  
let us live healthily.  
  
Susukhaṁ vata jīvāma,  
ussukesu anussukā;  
Ussukesu manussesu,  
viharāma anussukā.  
  
Let us live so very happily,  
content among the greedy.  
Among greedy people,  
let us live content.  
  
Susukhaṁ vata jīvāma,  
yesaṁ no natthi kiñcanaṁ;  
Pītibhakkhā bhavissāma,  
devā ābhassarā yathā.  
  
Let us live so very happily,  
we who have nothing.  
We shall feed on rapture,  
like the gods of streaming radiance.  
  
Jayaṁ veraṁ pasavati,  
dukkhaṁ seti parājito;  
Upasanto sukhaṁ seti,  
hitvā jayaparājayaṁ.  
  
Victory breeds enmity;  
the defeated sleep badly.  
The peaceful sleep at ease,  
having left victory and defeat behind.  
  
Natthi rāgasamo aggi,  
Natthi dosasamo kali;  
Natthi khandhasamā dukkhā,  
Natthi santiparaṁ sukhaṁ.  
  
There is no fire like greed,  
no crime like hate,  
no suffering like the aggregates,  
no bliss beyond peace.  
  
Jighacchāparamā rogā,  
saṅkhāraparamā dukhā;  
Etaṁ ñatvā yathābhūtaṁ,  
nibbānaṁ paramaṁ sukhaṁ.  
  
Hunger is the worst illness,  
conditions are the worst suffering,  
For one who truly knows this,  
extinguishment is the ultimate happiness.  
  
Ārogyaparamā lābhā,  
Santuṭṭhiparamaṁ dhanaṁ;  
Vissāsaparamā ñāti,  
Nibbānaṁ paramaṁ sukhaṁ.  
  
Health is the ultimate blessing;  
contentment, the ultimate wealth;  
trust is the ultimate family;  
extinguishment, the ultimate happiness.  
  
Pavivekarasaṁ pitvā,  
rasaṁ upasamassa ca;  
Niddaro hoti nippāpo,  
dhammapītirasaṁ pivaṁ.  
  
Having drunk the nectar of seclusion  
and the nectar of peace,  
free of stress, free of evil,  
one drinks the joyous nectar of Dhamma.  
  
Sāhu dassanamariyānaṁ,  
sannivāso sadā sukho;  
Adassanena bālānaṁ,  
niccameva sukhī siyā.  
  
It’s good to see the noble ones,  
staying with them is always good.  
Were you not to see fools,  
you’d always be happy.  
  
Bālasaṅgatacārī hi,  
dīghamaddhāna socati;  
Dukkho bālehi saṁvāso,  
amitteneva sabbadā;  
Dhīro ca sukhasaṁvāso,  
ñātīnaṁva samāgamo.  
  
For one who consorts with fools  
grieves long.  
Painful is dwelling with fools,  
like being stuck with your enemy.  
Happy is dwelling with a sage,  
like meeting with your kin.  
  
Tasmā hi—  
Dhīrañca paññañca bahussutañca,  
Dhorayhasīlaṁ vatavantamariyaṁ;  
Taṁ tādisaṁ sappurisaṁ sumedhaṁ,  
Bhajetha nakkhattapathaṁva candimā.  
  
Therefore:  
A sage, wise and learned,  
a mammoth of virtue, true to their vows, noble:  
follow a good and intelligent person such as this,  
as the moon tracks the path of the stars.  

### 16. Piyavagga: The Beloved

Ayoge yuñjamattānaṁ,  
yogasmiñca ayojayaṁ;  
Atthaṁ hitvā piyaggāhī,  
pihetattānuyoginaṁ.  
  
Applying yourself where you ought not,  
neglecting what you should be doing,  
forgetting your goal, you cling to what you hold dear,  
jealous of those devoted to their own goal.  
  
Mā piyehi samāgañchi,  
appiyehi kudācanaṁ;  
Piyānaṁ adassanaṁ dukkhaṁ,  
appiyānañca dassanaṁ.  
  
Don’t ever get too close  
to those you like or dislike.  
For not seeing the liked is suffering,  
and so is seeing the disliked.  
  
Tasmā piyaṁ na kayirātha,  
piyāpāyo hi pāpako;  
Ganthā tesaṁ na vijjanti,  
yesaṁ natthi piyāppiyaṁ.  
  
Therefore don’t hold anything dear,  
for it’s bad to lose those you love.  
No ties are found in they who  
hold nothing loved or loathed.  
  
Piyato jāyatī soko,  
piyato jāyatī bhayaṁ;  
Piyato vippamuttassa,  
natthi soko kuto bhayaṁ.  
  
Sorrow springs from what we hold dear,  
fear springs from what we hold dear;  
one free from holding anything dear  
has no sorrow, let alone fear.  
  
Pemato jāyatī soko,  
pemato jāyatī bhayaṁ;  
Pemato vippamuttassa,  
natthi soko kuto bhayaṁ.  
  
Sorrow springs from attachment,  
fear springs from attachment;  
one free from attachment  
has no sorrow, let alone fear.  
  
Ratiyā jāyatī soko,  
ratiyā jāyatī bhayaṁ;  
Ratiyā vippamuttassa,  
natthi soko kuto bhayaṁ.  
  
Sorrow springs from relishing,  
fear springs from relishing;  
one free from relishing  
has no sorrow, let alone fear.  
  
Kāmato jāyatī soko,  
kāmato jāyatī bhayaṁ;  
Kāmato vippamuttassa,  
natthi soko kuto bhayaṁ.  
  
Sorrow springs from desire,  
fear springs from desire;  
one free from desire  
has no sorrow, let alone fear.  
  
Taṇhāya jāyatī soko,  
taṇhāya jāyatī bhayaṁ;  
Taṇhāya vippamuttassa,  
natthi soko kuto bhayaṁ.  
  
Sorrow springs from craving,  
fear springs from craving;  
one free from craving  
has no sorrow, let alone fear.  
  
Sīladassanasampannaṁ,  
dhammaṭṭhaṁ saccavedinaṁ;  
Attano kamma kubbānaṁ,  
taṁ jano kurute piyaṁ.  
  
One accomplished in virtue and vision,  
firm in principle, and truthful,  
doing oneself what ought be done:  
that’s who the people love.  
  
Chandajāto anakkhāte,  
Manasā ca phuṭo siyā;  
Kāmesu ca appaṭibaddhacitto,  
Uddhaṁsototi vuccati.  
  
One eager to realize the ineffable  
would be filled with awareness.  
Their mind not bound to pleasures of sense,  
they’re said to be heading upstream.  
  
Cirappavāsiṁ purisaṁ,  
dūrato sotthimāgataṁ;  
Ñātimittā suhajjā ca,  
abhinandanti āgataṁ.  
  
When a man returns safely  
after a long time spent abroad,  
family, friends, and loved ones  
celebrate his return.  
  
Tatheva katapuññampi,  
asmā lokā paraṁ gataṁ;  
Puññāni paṭigaṇhanti,  
piyaṁ ñātīva āgataṁ.  
  
Just so, when one who has done good  
goes from this world to the next,  
their good deeds receive them there,  
as family welcomes home one they love.  

### 17. Kodhavagga: Anger

Kodhaṁ jahe vippajaheyya mānaṁ,  
Saṁyojanaṁ sabbamatikkameyya;  
Taṁ nāmarūpasmimasajjamānaṁ,  
Akiñcanaṁ nānupatanti dukkhā.  
  
Give up anger, get rid of conceit,  
and escape every fetter.  
Sufferings don’t befall one who has nothing,  
not clinging to name and form.  
  
Yo ve uppatitaṁ kodhaṁ,  
rathaṁ bhantaṁva vāraye;  
Tamahaṁ sārathiṁ brūmi,  
rasmiggāho itaro jano.  
  
When anger surges like a lurching chariot,  
keep it in check.  
That’s what I call a charioteer;  
others just hold the reins.  
  
Akkodhena jine kodhaṁ,  
asādhuṁ sādhunā jine;  
Jine kadariyaṁ dānena,  
saccenālikavādinaṁ.  
  
Defeat anger with kindness,  
villainy with virtue,  
stinginess with giving,  
and lies with truth.  
  
Saccaṁ bhaṇe na kujjheyya,  
dajjā appampi yācito;  
Etehi tīhi ṭhānehi,  
gacche devāna santike.  
  
Speak the truth, do not be angry,  
and give when asked, if only a little.  
By these three means,  
you may enter the presence of the gods.  
  
Ahiṁsakā ye munayo,  
niccaṁ kāyena saṁvutā;  
Te yanti accutaṁ ṭhānaṁ,  
yattha gantvā na socare.  
  
Those harmless sages,  
always restrained in body,  
go to the imperishable state,  
where there is no sorrow.  
  
Sadā jāgaramānānaṁ,  
ahorattānusikkhinaṁ;  
Nibbānaṁ adhimuttānaṁ,  
atthaṁ gacchanti āsavā.  
  
Always wakeful,  
practicing night and day,  
focused only on quenching,  
their defilements come to an end.  
  
Porāṇametaṁ atula,  
netaṁ ajjatanāmiva;  
Nindanti tuṇhimāsīnaṁ,  
nindanti bahubhāṇinaṁ;  
Mitabhāṇimpi nindanti,  
natthi loke anindito.  
  
It’s always been like this,  
it’s not just today.  
They blame you when you’re silent,  
they blame you when you speak a lot,  
and even when you speak just right:  
no-one in the world escapes blame.  
  
Na cāhu na ca bhavissati,  
na cetarahi vijjati;  
Ekantaṁ nindito poso,  
ekantaṁ vā pasaṁsito.  
  
There never was, nor will be,  
nor is there today,  
someone who is wholly praised  
or wholly blamed.  
  
Yañce viññū pasaṁsanti,  
anuvicca suve suve;  
Acchiddavuttiṁ medhāviṁ,  
paññāsīlasamāhitaṁ.  
  
If, after watching them day in day out,  
discerning people praise  
that sage of impeccable conduct,  
endowed with ethics and wisdom;  
  
Nikkhaṁ jambonadasseva,  
ko taṁ ninditumarahati;  
Devāpi naṁ pasaṁsanti,  
brahmunāpi pasaṁsito.  
  
like a pendant of river gold,  
who is worthy to criticize them?  
Even the gods praise them,  
and by Brahmā, too, they’re praised.  
  
Kāyappakopaṁ rakkheyya,  
kāyena saṁvuto siyā;  
Kāyaduccaritaṁ hitvā,  
kāyena sucaritaṁ care.  
  
Guard against ill-tempered deeds,  
be restrained in body.  
Giving up bad bodily conduct,  
conduct yourself well in body.  
  
Vacīpakopaṁ rakkheyya,  
vācāya saṁvuto siyā;  
Vacīduccaritaṁ hitvā,  
vācāya sucaritaṁ care.  
  
Guard against ill-tempered words,  
be restrained in speech.  
Giving up bad verbal conduct,  
conduct yourself well in speech.  
  
Manopakopaṁ rakkheyya,  
manasā saṁvuto siyā;  
Manoduccaritaṁ hitvā,  
manasā sucaritaṁ care.  
  
Guard against ill-tempered thoughts,  
be restrained in mind.  
Giving up bad mental conduct,  
conduct yourself well in mind.  
  
Kāyena saṁvutā dhīrā,  
atho vācāya saṁvutā;  
Manasā saṁvutā dhīrā,  
te ve suparisaṁvutā.  
  
A sage is restrained in body  
restrained also in speech,  
in thought, too, they are restrained:  
they are restrained in every way.  

### 18. Malavagga: Stains

Paṇḍupalāsova dānisi,  
Yamapurisāpi ca te upaṭṭhitā;  
Uyyogamukhe ca tiṭṭhasi,  
Pātheyyampi ca te na vijjati.  
  
Today you’re like a withered leaf,  
Yama’s men await you.  
You stand at the departure gates,  
yet you have no supplies for the road.  
  
So karohi dīpamattano,  
Khippaṁ vāyama paṇḍito bhava;  
Niddhantamalo anaṅgaṇo,  
Dibbaṁ ariyabhūmiṁ upehisi.  
  
Make an island of yourself!  
Swiftly strive, learn to be wise!  
Purged of stains, flawless,  
you’ll go to the divine realm of the noble ones.  
  
Upanītavayo ca dānisi,  
Sampayātosi yamassa santikaṁ;  
Vāso te natthi antarā,  
Pātheyyampi ca te na vijjati.  
  
You’ve journeyed the stages of life,  
and now you set out to meet Yama.  
Along the way there’s nowhere to stay,  
yet you have no supplies for the road.  
  
So karohi dīpamattano,  
Khippaṁ vāyama paṇḍito bhava;  
Niddhantamalo anaṅgaṇo,  
Na punaṁ jātijaraṁ upehisi.  
  
Make an island of yourself!  
Swiftly strive, learn to be wise!  
Purged of stains, flawless,  
you’ll not come again to rebirth and old age.  
  
Anupubbena medhāvī,  
thokaṁ thokaṁ khaṇe khaṇe;  
Kammāro rajatasseva,  
niddhame malamattano.  
  
A smart person would purge  
their own stains gradually,  
bit by bit, moment by moment,  
like a smith smelting silver.  
  
Ayasāva malaṁ samuṭṭhitaṁ,  
Tatuṭṭhāya tameva khādati;  
Evaṁ atidhonacārinaṁ,  
Sāni kammāni nayanti duggatiṁ.  
  
It is the rust born on the iron  
that eats away the place it arose.  
And so it is their own deeds  
that lead the overly-ascetic to a bad place.  
  
Asajjhāyamalā mantā,  
anuṭṭhānamalā gharā;  
Malaṁ vaṇṇassa kosajjaṁ,  
pamādo rakkhato malaṁ.  
  
Not reciting is the stain of hymns.  
The stain of houses is neglect.  
Laziness is the stain of beauty.  
A guard’s stain is negligence.  
  
Malitthiyā duccaritaṁ,  
maccheraṁ dadato malaṁ;  
Malā ve pāpakā dhammā,  
asmiṁ loke paramhi ca.  
  
Misconduct is a woman’s stain.  
A giver’s stain is stinginess.  
Bad qualities are a stain  
in this world and the next.  
  
Tato malā malataraṁ,  
avijjā paramaṁ malaṁ;  
Etaṁ malaṁ pahantvāna,  
nimmalā hotha bhikkhavo.  
  
But a worse stain than these  
is ignorance, the worst stain of all.  
Having given up that stain,  
be without stains, mendicants!  
  
Sujīvaṁ ahirikena,  
kākasūrena dhaṁsinā;  
Pakkhandinā pagabbhena,  
saṅkiliṭṭhena jīvitaṁ.  
  
Life is easy for the shameless.  
With all the rude courage of a crow,  
they live pushy,  
rude, and corrupt.  
  
Hirīmatā ca dujjīvaṁ,  
niccaṁ sucigavesinā;  
Alīnenāppagabbhena,  
suddhājīvena passatā.  
  
Life is hard for the conscientious,  
always seeking purity,  
neither clinging nor rude,  
pure of livelihood and discerning.  
  
Yo pāṇamatipāteti,  
musāvādañca bhāsati;  
Loke adinnamādiyati,  
paradārañca gacchati.  
  
Take anyone in this world  
who kills living creatures,  
speaks falsely, steals,  
commits adultery,  
  
Surāmerayapānañca,  
yo naro anuyuñjati;  
Idheva meso lokasmiṁ,  
mūlaṁ khaṇati attano.  
  
and indulges in drinking  
alcohol and liquor.  
Right here they dig up  
the root of their own self.  
  
Evaṁ bho purisa jānāhi,  
pāpadhammā asaññatā;  
Mā taṁ lobho adhammo ca,  
ciraṁ dukkhāya randhayuṁ.  
  
Know this, good sir:  
they are unrestrained and wicked.  
Don’t let greed and hate  
subject you to pain for long.  
  
Dadāti ve yathāsaddhaṁ,  
yathāpasādanaṁ jano;  
Tattha yo ca maṅku bhavati,  
paresaṁ pānabhojane;  
Na so divā vā rattiṁ vā,  
samādhimadhigacchati.  
  
The people give according to their faith,  
according to their confidence.  
If you get upset over that,  
over other’s food and drink,  
you’ll not, by day or by night,  
become immersed in samādhi.  
  
Yassa cetaṁ samucchinnaṁ,  
mūlaghaccaṁ samūhataṁ;  
Sa ve divā vā rattiṁ vā,  
samādhimadhigacchati.  
  
Those who have cut that out,  
dug it up at the root, eradicated it,  
they will, by day or by night,  
become immersed in samādhi.  
  
Natthi rāgasamo aggi,  
natthi dosasamo gaho;  
Natthi mohasamaṁ jālaṁ,  
natthi taṇhāsamā nadī.  
  
There is no fire like greed,  
no crime like hate,  
no net like delusion,  
no river like craving.  
  
Sudassaṁ vajjamaññesaṁ,  
attano pana duddasaṁ;  
Paresaṁ hi so vajjāni,  
opunāti yathā bhusaṁ;  
Attano pana chādeti,  
kaliṁva kitavā saṭho.  
  
It’s easy to see the faults of others,  
hard to see one’s own.  
For the faults of others  
are tossed high like chaff,  
while one’s own are hidden,  
as a cheat hides a bad hand.  
  
Paravajjānupassissa,  
niccaṁ ujjhānasaññino;  
Āsavā tassa vaḍḍhanti,  
ārā so āsavakkhayā.  
  
When you look for the flaws of others,  
always finding fault,  
your defilements only grow,  
you’re far from ending defilements.  
  
Ākāseva padaṁ natthi,  
samaṇo natthi bāhire;  
Papañcābhiratā pajā,  
nippapañcā tathāgatā.  
  
In the sky there is no track,  
there’s no true ascetic outside here.  
People enjoy proliferation,  
the Realized Ones are free of proliferation.  
  
Ākāseva padaṁ natthi,  
samaṇo natthi bāhire;  
Saṅkhārā sassatā natthi,  
natthi buddhānamiñjitaṁ.  
Malavaggo aṭṭhārasamo.  
  
In the sky there is no track,  
there’s no true ascetic outside here.  
No conditions last forever,  
the Awakened Ones are not shaken.  

### 19. Dhammaṭṭhavagga: The Just

Na tena hoti dhammaṭṭho,  
yenatthaṁ sāhasā naye;  
Yo ca atthaṁ anatthañca,  
ubho niccheyya paṇḍito.  
  
You don’t become just  
by passing hasty judgement.  
An astute person evaluates both  
what is pertinent and what is irrelevant.  
  
Asāhasena dhammena,  
samena nayatī pare;  
Dhammassa gutto medhāvī,  
“dhammaṭṭho”ti pavuccati.  
  
A wise one judges others without haste,  
justly and impartially;  
that guardian of the law  
is said to be just.  
  
Na tena paṇḍito hoti,  
yāvatā bahu bhāsati;  
Khemī averī abhayo,  
“paṇḍito”ti pavuccati.  
  
You’re not an astute scholar  
just because you speak a lot.  
One who is secure, free of enmity and fear,  
is said to be astute.  
  
Na tāvatā dhammadharo,  
yāvatā bahu bhāsati;  
Yo ca appampi sutvāna,  
dhammaṁ kāyena passati;  
Sa ve dhammadharo hoti,  
yo dhammaṁ nappamajjati.  
  
You’re not one who has memorized the teaching  
just because you recite a lot.  
Someone who directly sees the teaching  
after hearing only a little  
is truly one who has memorized the teaching,  
for they can never forget it.  
  
Na tena thero so hoti,  
yenassa palitaṁ siro;  
Paripakko vayo tassa,  
“moghajiṇṇo”ti vuccati.  
  
You don’t become a senior  
by getting some grey hairs;  
for one ripe only in age,  
is said to have aged in vain.  
  
Yamhi saccañca dhammo ca,  
ahiṁsā saṁyamo damo;  
Sa ve vantamalo dhīro,  
“thero” iti pavuccati.  
  
One who has truth and principle,  
harmlessness, restraint, and self-control,  
that wise one, purged of stains,  
is said to be a senior.  
  
Na vākkaraṇamattena,  
vaṇṇapokkharatāya vā;  
Sādhurūpo naro hoti,  
issukī maccharī saṭho.  
  
Not by mere eloquence,  
or a beautiful complexion  
does a person appear holy,  
if they’re jealous, stingy, and devious.  
  
Yassa cetaṁ samucchinnaṁ,  
mūlaghaccaṁ samūhataṁ;  
Sa vantadoso medhāvī,  
“sādhurūpo”ti vuccati.  
  
But if they’ve cut that out,  
dug it up at the root, eradicated it,  
that wise one, purged of vice,  
is said to be holy.  
  
Na muṇḍakena samaṇo,  
abbato alikaṁ bhaṇaṁ;  
Icchālobhasamāpanno,  
samaṇo kiṁ bhavissati.  
  
A liar and breaker of vows is no ascetic  
just because they shave their head.  
How on earth can one be an ascetic  
who’s full of desire and greed?  
  
Yo ca sameti pāpāni,  
aṇuṁthūlāni sabbaso;  
Samitattā hi pāpānaṁ,  
“samaṇo”ti pavuccati.  
  
One who stops all wicked deeds,  
great and small,  
because of stopping wicked deeds  
is said to be an ascetic.  
  
Na tena bhikkhu so hoti,  
yāvatā bhikkhate pare;  
Vissaṁ dhammaṁ samādāya,  
bhikkhu hoti na tāvatā.  
  
You don’t become a mendicant  
just by begging from others.  
One who has undertaken domestic duties  
has not yet become a mendicant.  
  
Yodha puññañca pāpañca,  
bāhetvā brahmacariyavā;  
Saṅkhāya loke carati,  
sa ve “bhikkhū”ti vuccati.  
  
But one living a spiritual life,  
who has banished both merit and evil,  
who wanders having assessed the world,  
is said to be a mendicant.  
  
Na monena munī hoti,  
mūḷharūpo aviddasu;  
Yo ca tulaṁva paggayha,  
varamādāya paṇḍito.  
  
You don’t become a sage by silence,  
while still confused and ignorant.  
The astute one holds up the scales,  
taking only the best,  
  
Pāpāni parivajjeti,  
sa munī tena so muni;  
Yo munāti ubho loke,  
“muni” tena pavuccati.  
  
and rejecting the bad;  
a sage becomes a sage by measuring.  
One who measures good and bad in the world,  
is thereby said to be a sage.  
  
Na tena ariyo hoti,  
yena pāṇāni hiṁsati;  
Ahiṁsā sabbapāṇānaṁ,  
“ariyo”ti pavuccati.  
  
You don’t become a noble one  
by harming living beings.  
One harmless towards all living beings  
is said to be a noble one.  
  
Na sīlabbatamattena,  
bāhusaccena vā pana;  
Atha vā samādhilābhena,  
vivittasayanena vā.  
  
Not by precepts and observances,  
nor by much learning,  
nor by meditative immersion,  
nor by living in seclusion,  
  
Phusāmi nekkhammasukhaṁ,  
aputhujjanasevitaṁ;  
Bhikkhu vissāsamāpādi,  
appatto āsavakkhayaṁ.  
Dhammaṭṭhavaggo ekūnavīsatimo.  
  
do I experience the bliss of renunciation  
not frequented by ordinary people.  
A mendicant cannot rest confident  
without attaining the end of defilements.  

### 20. Maggavagga: The Path

Maggānaṭṭhaṅgiko seṭṭho,  
saccānaṁ caturo padā;  
Virāgo seṭṭho dhammānaṁ,  
dvipadānañca cakkhumā.  
  
Of paths, the eightfold is the best;  
of truths, the four statements;  
dispassion is the best of things,  
and the Seer is the best of humans.  
  
Eseva maggo natthañño,  
Dassanassa visuddhiyā;  
Etañhi tumhe paṭipajjatha,  
Mārassetaṁ pamohanaṁ.  
  
This is the path, there is no other  
for the purification of vision.  
You all must practice this,  
it is the way to baffle Māra.  
  
Etañhi tumhe paṭipannā,  
dukkhassantaṁ karissatha;  
Akkhāto vo mayā maggo,  
aññāya sallakantanaṁ.  
  
When you all are practicing this,  
you will make an end of suffering.  
I have explained the path to you  
for extracting the thorn with wisdom.  
  
Tumhehi kiccamātappaṁ,  
akkhātāro tathāgatā;  
Paṭipannā pamokkhanti,  
jhāyino mārabandhanā.  
  
You yourselves must do the work,  
the Realized Ones just show the way.  
Meditators practicing absorption  
are released from Māra’s bonds.  
  
“Sabbe saṅkhārā aniccā”ti,  
yadā paññāya passati;  
Atha nibbindati dukkhe,  
esa maggo visuddhiyā.  
  
All conditions are impermanent—  
when this is seen with wisdom,  
one grows disillusioned with suffering:  
this is the path to purity.  
  
“Sabbe saṅkhārā dukkhā”ti,  
yadā paññāya passati;  
Atha nibbindati dukkhe,  
esa maggo visuddhiyā.  
  
All conditions are suffering—  
when this is seen with wisdom,  
one grows disillusioned with suffering:  
this is the path to purity.  
  
“Sabbe dhammā anattā”ti,  
yadā paññāya passati;  
Atha nibbindati dukkhe,  
esa maggo visuddhiyā.  
  
All things are not-self—  
when this is seen with wisdom,  
one grows disillusioned with suffering:  
this is the path to purity.  
  
Uṭṭhānakālamhi anuṭṭhahāno,  
Yuvā balī ālasiyaṁ upeto;  
Saṁsannasaṅkappamano kusīto,  
Paññāya maggaṁ alaso na vindati.  
  
They don’t get going when it’s time to start;  
they’re young and strong, but given to sloth.  
Their mind depressed in sunken thought,  
lazy and slothful, they can’t discern the path.  
  
Vācānurakkhī manasā susaṁvuto,  
Kāyena ca nākusalaṁ kayirā;  
Ete tayo kammapathe visodhaye,  
Ārādhaye maggamisippaveditaṁ.  
  
Guarded in speech, restrained in mind,  
doing no unskillful bodily deed.  
Purify these three ways of performing deeds,  
and win the path known to hermits.  
  
Yogā ve jāyatī bhūri,  
ayogā bhūrisaṅkhayo;  
Etaṁ dvedhāpathaṁ ñatvā,  
bhavāya vibhavāya ca;  
Tathāttānaṁ niveseyya,  
yathā bhūri pavaḍḍhati.  
  
From meditation springs wisdom,  
without meditation, wisdom ends.  
Knowing these two paths—  
of progress and decline—  
you should conduct yourself  
so that wisdom grows.  
  
Vanaṁ chindatha mā rukkhaṁ,  
vanato jāyate bhayaṁ;  
Chetvā vanañca vanathañca,  
nibbanā hotha bhikkhavo.  
  
Cut down the jungle, not just a tree;  
from the jungle springs fear.  
Having cut down jungle and vine,  
be free of jungles, mendicants!  
  
Yāva hi vanatho na chijjati,  
Aṇumattopi narassa nārisu;  
Paṭibaddhamanova tāva so,  
Vaccho khīrapakova mātari.  
  
So long as the vine, no matter how small,  
that ties a man to women is not cut,  
his mind remains trapped,  
like a calf suckling its mother.  
  
Ucchinda sinehamattano,  
Kumudaṁ sāradikaṁva pāṇinā;  
Santimaggameva brūhaya,  
Nibbānaṁ sugatena desitaṁ.  
  
Cut out fondness for oneself,  
like plucking an autumn lotus.  
Foster only the path to peace,  
the quenching the Holy One taught.  
  
Idha vassaṁ vasissāmi,  
idha hemantagimhisu;  
Iti bālo vicinteti,  
antarāyaṁ na bujjhati.  
  
“Here I will stay for the rains;  
here for winter, here the summer”;  
thus the fool thinks,  
not realizing the danger.  
  
Taṁ puttapasusammattaṁ,  
byāsattamanasaṁ naraṁ;  
Suttaṁ gāmaṁ mahoghova,  
maccu ādāya gacchati.  
  
As a mighty flood sweeps away a sleeping village,  
death steals away a man  
who dotes on children and cattle,  
his mind caught up in them.  
  
Na santi puttā tāṇāya,  
na pitā nāpi bandhavā;  
Antakenādhipannassa,  
natthi ñātīsu tāṇatā.  
  
Children provide you no shelter,  
nor does father, nor relatives.  
When you’re seized by the terminator,  
there’s no shelter in family.  
  
Etamatthavasaṁ ñatvā,  
paṇḍito sīlasaṁvuto;  
Nibbānagamanaṁ maggaṁ,  
khippameva visodhaye.  
Maggavaggo vīsatimo.  
  
Knowing the reason for this,  
astute, and ethically restrained,  
one would quickly clear the path  
that leads to extinguishment.  

### 21. Pakiṇṇakavagga: Miscellaneous

passe ce vipulaṁ sukhaṁ;  
Caje mattāsukhaṁ dhīro,

one sees abundant happiness,  
a wise one would give up material happiness,  
seeing the abundant happiness.

Verasaṁsaggasaṁsaṭṭho,

by imposing suffering on others.

atthaṁ gacchanti āsavā.  
  
Those that have properly undertaken  
constant mindfulness of the body,  
don’t cultivate what should not be done,  
but always do what should be done.  
Mindful and aware,  
their defilements come to an end.  
  
Mātaraṁ pitaraṁ hantvā,  
rājāno dve ca khattiye;

so don’t be a traveler,  
don’t be prey to pain.

Sitting alone, sleeping alone,  
tirelessly wandering alone;  
one who tames themselves alone  
would delight within a forest.  

### 22. Nirayavagga: Hell

Abhūtavādī nirayaṁ upeti,  
Yo vāpi katvā na karomi cāha;  
Ubhopi te pecca samā bhavanti,  
Nihīnakammā manujā parattha.  
  
A liar goes to hell,  
as does one who denies what they did.  
Both are equal in the hereafter,  
those men of base deeds.  
  
Kāsāvakaṇṭhā bahavo,  
pāpadhammā asaññatā;  
Pāpā pāpehi kammehi,  
nirayaṁ te upapajjare.  
  
Many who wrap their necks in ocher robes  
are unrestrained and wicked.  
Being wicked, they are reborn in hell  
due to their bad deeds.  
  
Seyyo ayoguḷo bhutto,  
tatto aggisikhūpamo;  
Yañce bhuñjeyya dussīlo,  
raṭṭhapiṇḍamasaññato.  
  
It’d be better for the immoral and unrestrained  
to eat an iron ball,  
scorching, like a burning flame,  
than to eat the nation’s alms.  
  
Cattāri ṭhānāni naro pamatto,  
Āpajjati paradārūpasevī;  
Apuññalābhaṁ na nikāmaseyyaṁ,  
Nindaṁ tatīyaṁ nirayaṁ catutthaṁ.  
  
Four things befall a heedless man  
who sleeps with another’s wife:  
bad karma, poor sleep,  
ill-repute, and rebirth in hell.  
  
Apuññalābho ca gatī ca pāpikā,  
Bhītassa bhītāya ratī ca thokikā;  
Rājā ca daṇḍaṁ garukaṁ paṇeti,  
Tasmā naro paradāraṁ na seve.  
  
He accrues bad karma and is reborn in a bad place,  
all so a frightened couple may snatch a moment’s pleasure,  
for which rulers impose a heavy punishment.  
That’s why a man should not sleep with another’s wife.  
  
Kuso yathā duggahito,  
hatthamevānukantati;  
Sāmaññaṁ dupparāmaṭṭhaṁ,  
nirayāyupakaḍḍhati.  
  
When kusa grass is wrongly grasped  
it only cuts the hand.  
So too, the ascetic life, when wrongly taken,  
drags you to hell.  
  
Yaṁ kiñci sithilaṁ kammaṁ,  
saṅkiliṭṭhañca yaṁ vataṁ;  
Saṅkassaraṁ brahmacariyaṁ,  
na taṁ hoti mahapphalaṁ.  
  
Any lax act,  
any corrupt observance,  
or suspicious spiritual life,  
is not very fruitful.  
  
Kayirā ce kayirāthenaṁ,  
daḷhamenaṁ parakkame;  
Sithilo hi paribbājo,  
bhiyyo ākirate rajaṁ.  
  
If one is to do what should be done,  
one should staunchly strive.  
For the life gone forth when laxly led  
just stirs up dust all the more.  
  
Akataṁ dukkaṭaṁ seyyo,  
pacchā tappati dukkaṭaṁ;  
Katañca sukataṁ seyyo,  
yaṁ katvā nānutappati.  
  
A bad deed is better left undone,  
for it will plague you later on.  
A good deed is better done,  
one that does not plague you.  
  
Nagaraṁ yathā paccantaṁ,  
guttaṁ santarabāhiraṁ;  
Evaṁ gopetha attānaṁ,  
khaṇo vo mā upaccagā;  
Khaṇātītā hi socanti,  
nirayamhi samappitā.  
  
As a frontier city  
is guarded inside and out,  
so you should ward yourselves—  
don’t let the moment pass you by.  
For if you miss your moment  
you’ll grieve when sent to hell.  
  
Alajjitāye lajjanti,  
lajjitāye na lajjare;  
Micchādiṭṭhisamādānā,  
sattā gacchanti duggatiṁ.  
  
Unashamed of what is shameful,  
ashamed of what is not shameful;  
beings who uphold wrong view  
go to a bad place.  
  
Abhaye bhayadassino,  
bhaye cābhayadassino;  
Micchādiṭṭhisamādānā,  
sattā gacchanti duggatiṁ.  
  
Seeing danger where there is none,  
and blind to the actual danger,  
beings who uphold wrong view  
go to a bad place.  
  
Avajje vajjamatino,  
vajje cāvajjadassino;  
Micchādiṭṭhisamādānā,  
sattā gacchanti duggatiṁ.  
  
Seeing fault where there is none,  
and blind to the actual fault,  
beings who uphold wrong view  
go to a bad place.  
  
Vajjañca vajjato ñatvā,  
avajjañca avajjato;  
Sammādiṭṭhisamādānā,  
sattā gacchanti suggatiṁ.  
  
Knowing a fault as a fault  
and the faultless as faultless,  
beings who uphold right view  
go to a good place.  

### 23. Nāgavagga: Elephants

Ahaṁ nāgova saṅgāme,  
cāpato patitaṁ saraṁ;  
Ativākyaṁ titikkhissaṁ,  
dussīlo hi bahujjano.  
  
Like an elephant struck  
with arrows in battle,  
I shall put up with abuse,  
for so many folk are badly behaved.  
  
Dantaṁ nayanti samitiṁ,  
dantaṁ rājābhirūhati;  
Danto seṭṭho manussesu,  
yotivākyaṁ titikkhati.  
  
The well-tamed beast is the one led to the crowd;  
the tamed elephant’s the one the king mounts;  
the tamed person who endures abuse  
is the best of human beings.  
  
Varamassatarā dantā,  
ājānīyā ca sindhavā;  
Kuñjarā ca mahānāgā,  
attadanto tato varaṁ.  
  
Those who have tamed themselves are better  
than fine tamed mules,  
thoroughbreds from Sindh,  
or giant tuskers.  
  
Na hi etehi yānehi,  
gaccheyya agataṁ disaṁ;  
Yathāttanā sudantena,  
danto dantena gacchati.  
  
For not on those mounts  
would you go to the untrodden place,  
whereas, with the help of one whose self is well tamed,  
you go there, tamed by the tamed.  
  
Dhanapālo nāma kuñjaro,  
Kaṭukabhedano dunnivārayo;  
Baddho kabaḷaṁ na bhuñjati,  
Sumarati nāgavanassa kuñjaro.  
  
The tusker named Dhanapāla  
is musky in rut, hard to control.  
Bound, he eats not a bite,  
for he misses the elephant forest.  
  
Middhī yadā hoti mahagghaso ca,  
Niddāyitā samparivattasāyī;  
Mahāvarāhova nivāpapuṭṭho,  
Punappunaṁ gabbhamupeti mando.  
  
One who gets drowsy from overeating,  
fond of sleep, rolling round the bed  
like a great hog stuffed with grain:  
that idiot is reborn again and again.  
  
Idaṁ pure cittamacāri cārikaṁ,  
Yenicchakaṁ yatthakāmaṁ yathāsukhaṁ;  
Tadajjahaṁ niggahessāmi yoniso,  
Hatthippabhinnaṁ viya aṅkusaggaho.  
  
In the past my mind wandered  
how it wished, where it liked, as it pleased.  
Now I’ll carefully guide it,  
as a trainer with a hook guides a rutting elephant.  
  
Appamādaratā hotha,  
sacittamanurakkhatha;  
Duggā uddharathattānaṁ,  
paṅke sannova kuñjaro.  
  
Delight in diligence!  
Take good care of your mind!  
Pull yourself out of this pit,  
like an elephant sunk in a bog.  
  
Sace labhetha nipakaṁ sahāyaṁ,  
Saddhiṁ caraṁ sādhuvihāridhīraṁ;  
Abhibhuyya sabbāni parissayāni,  
Careyya tenattamano satīmā.  
  
If you find an alert companion,  
a wise and virtuous friend,  
then, overcoming all adversities,  
wander with them, joyful and mindful.  
  
No ce labhetha nipakaṁ sahāyaṁ,  
Saddhiṁ caraṁ sādhuvihāridhīraṁ;  
Rājāva raṭṭhaṁ vijitaṁ pahāya,  
Eko care mātaṅgaraññeva nāgo.  
  
If you find no alert companion,  
no wise and virtuous friend,  
then, like a king who flees his conquered realm,  
wander alone like a tusker in the wilds.  
  
Ekassa caritaṁ seyyo,  
Natthi bāle sahāyatā;  
Eko care na ca pāpāni kayirā,  
Appossukko mātaṅgaraññeva nāgo.  
  
It’s better to wander alone,  
there’s no fellowship with fools.  
Wander alone and do no wrong,  
at ease like a tusker in the wilds.  
  
Atthamhi jātamhi sukhā sahāyā,  
Tuṭṭhī sukhā yā itarītarena;  
Puññaṁ sukhaṁ jīvitasaṅkhayamhi,  
Sabbassa dukkhassa sukhaṁ pahānaṁ.  
  
A friend in need is a blessing;  
it’s a blessing to be content with whatever;  
good deeds are a blessing at the end of life,  
and giving up all suffering is a blessing.  
  
Sukhā matteyyatā loke,  
atho petteyyatā sukhā;  
Sukhā sāmaññatā loke,  
atho brahmaññatā sukhā.  
  
In this world it’s a blessing to serve  
one’s mother and one’s father.  
And it’s a blessing also to serve  
ascetics and brahmins.  
  
Sukhaṁ yāva jarā sīlaṁ,  
sukhā saddhā patiṭṭhitā;  
Sukho paññāya paṭilābho,  
pāpānaṁ akaraṇaṁ sukhaṁ.  
  
It’s a blessing to keep precepts until you grow old;  
a blessing to be grounded in faith;  
the getting of wisdom’s a blessing;  
and it’s a blessing to avoid doing wrong.  

### 24. Taṇhāvagga: Craving

Manujassa pamattacārino,  
Taṇhā vaḍḍhati māluvā viya;  
So plavatī hurā huraṁ,  
Phalamicchaṁva vanasmi vānaro.  
  
When a person lives heedlessly,  
craving grows in them like a parasitic creeper.  
They jump from life to life, like a monkey  
greedy for fruit in a forest grove.  
  
Yaṁ esā sahate jammī,  
taṇhā loke visattikā;  
Sokā tassa pavaḍḍhanti,  
abhivaṭṭhaṁva bīraṇaṁ.  
  
Whoever is beaten by this wretched craving,  
this attachment to the world,  
their sorrow grows,  
like grass in the rain.  
  
Yo cetaṁ sahate jammiṁ,  
taṇhaṁ loke duraccayaṁ;  
Sokā tamhā papatanti,  
udabinduva pokkharā.  
  
But whoever prevails over this wretched craving,  
so hard to get over in the world,  
their sorrows fall from them,  
like a drop from a lotus-leaf.  
  
Taṁ vo vadāmi bhaddaṁ vo,  
yāvantettha samāgatā;  
Taṇhāya mūlaṁ khaṇatha,  
usīratthova bīraṇaṁ;  
Mā vo naḷaṁva sotova,  
māro bhañji punappunaṁ.  
  
I say this to you, good people,  
all those who have gathered here:  
dig up the root of craving,  
as you’d dig up grass in search of roots.  
Don’t let Māra break you again and again,  
like a stream breaking a reed.  
  
Yathāpi mūle anupaddave daḷhe,  
Chinnopi rukkho punareva rūhati;  
Evampi taṇhānusaye anūhate,  
Nibbattatī dukkhamidaṁ punappunaṁ.  
  
A tree grows back even when cut down,  
so long as its roots are healthy;  
suffering springs up again and again,  
so long as the tendency to craving is not pulled out.  
  
Yassa chattiṁsati sotā,  
manāpasavanā bhusā;  
Mahāvahanti duddiṭṭhiṁ,  
saṅkappā rāganissitā.  
  
A person of low views  
in whom the thirty-six streams  
that flow to pleasure are mighty,  
is swept away by lustful thoughts.  
  
Savanti sabbadhi sotā,  
latā uppajja tiṭṭhati;  
Tañca disvā lataṁ jātaṁ,  
mūlaṁ paññāya chindatha.  
  
The streams flow everywhere;  
a weed springs up and remains.  
Seeing this weed that has been born,  
cut the root with wisdom.  
  
Saritāni sinehitāni ca,  
Somanassāni bhavanti jantuno;  
Te sātasitā sukhesino,  
Te ve jātijarūpagā narā.  
  
A persons’s joys  
flow from senses and cravings.  
Seekers of happiness, bent on pleasure,  
continue to be reborn and grow old.  
  
Tasiṇāya purakkhatā pajā,  
Parisappanti sasova bandhito;  
Saṁyojanasaṅgasattakā,  
Dukkhamupenti punappunaṁ cirāya.  
  
People governed by thirst,  
crawl about like a trapped rabbit.  
Bound and fettered, for a long time  
they return to pain time and again.  
  
Tasiṇāya purakkhatā pajā,  
Parisappanti sasova bandhito;  
Tasmā tasiṇaṁ vinodaye,  
Ākaṅkhanta virāgamattano.  
  
People governed by thirst,  
crawl about like a trapped rabbit.  
That’s why one who longs for dispassion  
should dispel thirst.  
  
Yo nibbanatho vanādhimutto,  
Vanamutto vanameva dhāvati;  
Taṁ puggalametha passatha,  
Mutto bandhanameva dhāvati.  
  
Rejecting the household jungle, they set out for the real jungle,  
then they run right back to the jungle they left behind.  
Just look at this person!  
Freed, they run to bondage.  
  
Na taṁ daḷhaṁ bandhanamāhu dhīrā,  
Yadāyasaṁ dārujapabbajañca;  
Sārattarattā maṇikuṇḍalesu,  
Puttesu dāresu ca yā apekkhā.  
  
The wise say that shackle is not strong  
that’s made of iron, wood, or knots.  
But obsession with jeweled earrings,  
concern for your partners and children:  
  
Etaṁ daḷhaṁ bandhanamāhu dhīrā,  
Ohārinaṁ sithilaṁ duppamuñcaṁ;  
Etampi chetvāna paribbajanti,  
Anapekkhino kāmasukhaṁ pahāya.  
  
this, say the wise, is a strong shackle  
dragging the indulgent down, hard to escape.  
Having cut this one too they go forth,  
unconcerned, having given up sensual pleasures.  
  
Ye rāgarattānupatanti sotaṁ,  
Sayaṅkataṁ makkaṭakova jālaṁ;  
Etampi chetvāna vajanti dhīrā,  
Anapekkhino sabbadukkhaṁ pahāya.  
  
Besotted by lust they fall into the stream,  
like a spider caught in the web she wove.  
The wise proceed, having cut this one too,  
unconcerned, having given up all suffering.  
  
Muñca pure muñca pacchato,  
Majjhe muñca bhavassa pāragū;  
Sabbattha vimuttamānaso,  
Na punaṁ jātijaraṁ upehisi.  
  
Let go of the past, let go of the future,  
let go of the present, having gone beyond rebirth.  
With your heart freed in every respect,  
you’ll not come again to rebirth and old age.  
  
Vitakkamathitassa jantuno,  
Tibbarāgassa subhānupassino;  
Bhiyyo taṇhā pavaḍḍhati,  
Esa kho daḷhaṁ karoti bandhanaṁ.  
  
For a person crushed by thoughts,  
very lustful, focusing on beauty,  
their craving grows and grows,  
tying them with a stout bond.  
  
Vitakkūpasame ca yo rato,  
Asubhaṁ bhāvayate sadā sato;  
Esa kho byanti kāhiti,  
Esa checchati mārabandhanaṁ.  
  
But one who loves to calm their thoughts,  
developing perception of ugliness, ever mindful,  
will surely eliminate that craving,  
cutting off the bonds of Māra.  
  
Niṭṭhaṅgato asantāsī,  
vītataṇho anaṅgaṇo;  
Acchindi bhavasallāni,  
antimoyaṁ samussayo.  
  
One who is confident, unafraid,  
rid of craving, free of blemish,  
having struck down the arrows flying to future lives,  
this bag of bones is their last.  
  
Vītataṇho anādāno,  
Niruttipadakovido;  
Akkharānaṁ sannipātaṁ,  
Jaññā pubbāparāni ca;  
Sa ve “antimasārīro,  
Mahāpañño mahāpuriso”ti vuccati.  
  
Rid of craving, free of grasping,  
expert in the interpretation of terms,  
knowing the correct  
structure and sequence of syllables,  
they are said to be one who bears their final body,  
one of great wisdom, a great person.  
  
Sabbābhibhū sabbavidūhamasmi,  
Sabbesu dhammesu anūpalitto;  
Sabbañjaho taṇhakkhaye vimutto,  
Sayaṁ abhiññāya kamuddiseyyaṁ.  
  
I am the champion, the knower of all,  
unsullied in the midst of all things.  
I’ve given up all, freed in the ending of craving.  
Since I know for myself, whose follower should I be?  
  
Sabbadānaṁ dhammadānaṁ jināti,  
Sabbarasaṁ dhammaraso jināti;  
Sabbaratiṁ dhammarati jināti,  
Taṇhakkhayo sabbadukkhaṁ jināti.  
  
The gift of the teaching beats all other gifts;  
the taste of the teaching beats all other tastes;  
the joy of the teaching beats all other joys;  
one who has ended craving beats all suffering.  
  
Hananti bhogā dummedhaṁ,  
no ca pāragavesino;  
Bhogataṇhāya dummedho,  
hanti aññeva attanaṁ.  
  
Riches ruin an idiot,  
but not a seeker of the far shore.  
From craving for wealth, an idiot  
ruins themselves and others.  
  
Tiṇadosāni khettāni,  
rāgadosā ayaṁ pajā;  
Tasmā hi vītarāgesu,  
dinnaṁ hoti mahapphalaṁ.  
  
Weeds are the bane of crops,  
but greed is these folk’s bane.  
That’s why a gift to one rid of greed  
is so very fruitful.  
  
Tiṇadosāni khettāni,  
dosadosā ayaṁ pajā;  
Tasmā hi vītadosesu,  
dinnaṁ hoti mahapphalaṁ.  
  
Weeds are the bane of crops,  
but hate is these folk’s bane.  
That’s why a gift to one rid of hate  
is so very fruitful.  
  
Tiṇadosāni khettāni,  
mohadosā ayaṁ pajā;  
Tasmā hi vītamohesu,  
dinnaṁ hoti mahapphalaṁ.  
  
Weeds are the bane of crops,  
but delusion is these folk’s bane.  
That’s why a gift to one rid of delusion  
is so very fruitful.  
  
Tiṇadosāni khettāni,  
icchādosā ayaṁ pajā;  
Tasmā hi vigaticchesu,  
dinnaṁ hoti mahapphalaṁ.  
  
Weeds are the bane of crops,  
but desire is these folk’s bane.  
That’s why a gift to one rid of desire  
is so very fruitful.  

### 25. Bhikkhuvagga: Mendicants

Cakkhunā saṁvaro sādhu,  
sādhu sotena saṁvaro;  
Ghānena saṁvaro sādhu,  
sādhu jivhāya saṁvaro.  
  
Restraint of the eye is good;  
good is restraint of the ear;  
restraint of the nose is good;  
good is restraint of the tongue.  
  
Kāyena saṁvaro sādhu,  
sādhu vācāya saṁvaro;  
Manasā saṁvaro sādhu,  
sādhu sabbattha saṁvaro;  
Sabbattha saṁvuto bhikkhu,  
sabbadukkhā pamuccati.  
  
Restraint of the body is good;  
good is restraint of speech;  
restraint of mind is good;  
everywhere, restraint is good.  
The mendicant restrained everywhere  
is released from suffering.  
  
Hatthasaṁyato pādasaṁyato,  
Vācāsaṁyato saṁyatuttamo;  
Ajjhattarato samāhito,  
Eko santusito tamāhu bhikkhuṁ.  
  
One restrained in hand and foot,  
and in speech, the supreme restraint;  
happy inside, serene,  
solitary, content, I call a mendicant.  
  
Yo mukhasaṁyato bhikkhu,  
mantabhāṇī anuddhato;  
Atthaṁ dhammañca dīpeti,  
madhuraṁ tassa bhāsitaṁ.  
  
When a mendicant of restrained mouth,  
thoughtful in counsel, and stable,  
explains the text and its meaning,  
their words are sweet.  
  
Dhammārāmo dhammarato,  
dhammaṁ anuvicintayaṁ;  
Dhammaṁ anussaraṁ bhikkhu,  
saddhammā na parihāyati.  
  
Delighting in the teaching, enjoying the teaching,  
contemplating the teaching,  
a mendicant who recollects the teaching  
doesn’t decline in the true teaching.  
  
Salābhaṁ nātimaññeyya,  
nāññesaṁ pihayaṁ care;  
Aññesaṁ pihayaṁ bhikkhu,  
samādhiṁ nādhigacchati.  
  
A well-off mendicant ought not look down  
on others, nor should they be envious.  
A mendicant who envies others  
does not achieve immersion.  
  
Appalābhopi ce bhikkhu,  
salābhaṁ nātimaññati;  
Taṁ ve devā pasaṁsanti,  
suddhājīviṁ atanditaṁ.  
  
If a mendicant is poor in offerings,  
the well-to-do ought not look down on them.  
For the gods indeed praise them,  
who are tireless and pure of livelihood.  
  
Sabbaso nāmarūpasmiṁ,  
yassa natthi mamāyitaṁ;  
Asatā ca na socati,  
sa ve “bhikkhū”ti vuccati.  
  
One who has no sense of ownership  
in the whole realm of name and form,  
who does not grieve for that which is not,  
is said to be a mendicant.  
  
Mettāvihārī yo bhikkhu,  
pasanno buddhasāsane;  
Adhigacche padaṁ santaṁ,  
saṅkhārūpasamaṁ sukhaṁ.  
  
A mendicant who meditates on love,  
devoted to the Buddha’s teaching,  
would realize the peaceful state,  
the blissful stilling of conditions.  
  
Siñca bhikkhu imaṁ nāvaṁ,  
sittā te lahumessati;  
Chetvā rāgañca dosañca,  
tato nibbānamehisi.  
  
Bail out this boat, mendicant!  
When bailed out it will float lightly.  
Having cut off desire and hate,  
you shall reach quenching.  
  
Pañca chinde pañca jahe,  
pañca cuttari bhāvaye;  
Pañca saṅgātigo bhikkhu,  
“oghatiṇṇo”ti vuccati.  
  
Five to cut, five to drop,  
and five more to develop.  
A mendicant who escapes five chains  
is said to have crossed the flood.  
  
Jhāya bhikkhu mā pamādo,  
Mā te kāmaguṇe ramessu cittaṁ;  
Mā lohaguḷaṁ gilī pamatto,  
Mā kandi “dukkhamidan”ti dayhamāno.  
  
Practice absorption, don’t be negligent!  
Don’t let the mind delight in the senses!  
Don’t heedlessly swallow a hot iron ball!  
And when it burns, don’t cry, “Oh, the pain!”  
  
Natthi jhānaṁ apaññassa,  
paññā natthi ajhāyato;  
Yamhi jhānañca paññā ca,  
sa ve nibbānasantike.  
  
No absorption for one without wisdom,  
no wisdom for one without absorption.  
But one with absorption and wisdom—  
they have truly drawn near to extinguishment.  
  
Suññāgāraṁ paviṭṭhassa,  
santacittassa bhikkhuno;  
Amānusī rati hoti,  
sammā dhammaṁ vipassato.  
  
A mendicant who enters an empty hut  
with mind at peace  
finds a superhuman delight  
as they rightly discern the Dhamma.  
  
Yato yato sammasati,  
khandhānaṁ udayabbayaṁ;  
Labhatī pītipāmojjaṁ,  
amataṁ taṁ vijānataṁ.  
  
Whenever they are mindful  
of the rise and fall of the aggregates,  
they feel rapture and joy:  
that is the deathless for one who knows.  
  
Tatrāyamādi bhavati,  
idha paññassa bhikkhuno;  
Indriyagutti santuṭṭhi,  
pātimokkhe ca saṁvaro.  
  
This is the very start of the path  
for a wise mendicant:  
guarding the senses, contentment,  
and restraint in the monastic code.  
  
Mitte bhajassu kalyāṇe,  
suddhājīve atandite;  
Paṭisanthāravutyassa,  
ācārakusalo siyā;  
Tato pāmojjabahulo,  
dukkhassantaṁ karissati.  
  
Mix with spiritual friends,  
who are tireless and pure of livelihood.  
Share what you have with others,  
being skillful in your conduct.  
And when you’re full of joy,  
you’ll make an end to suffering.  
  
Vassikā viya pupphāni,  
maddavāni pamuñcati;  
Evaṁ rāgañca dosañca,  
vippamuñcetha bhikkhavo.  
  
As a jasmine sheds  
its withered flowers,  
O mendicants,  
cast off greed and hate.  
  
Santakāyo santavāco,  
santavā susamāhito;  
Vantalokāmiso bhikkhu,  
“upasanto”ti vuccati.  
  
Calm in body, calm in speech,  
peaceful and serene;  
a mendicant who’s spat out the world’s bait  
is said to be one at peace.  
  
Attanā codayattānaṁ,  
paṭimaṁsetha attanā;  
So attagutto satimā,  
sukhaṁ bhikkhu vihāhisi.  
  
Urge yourself on,  
reflect on yourself.  
A mendicant self-controlled and mindful  
will always dwell in happiness.  
  
Attā hi attano nātho,  
ko hi nātho paro siyā;  
Attā hi attano gati,  
tasmā saṁyamamattānaṁ;  
Assaṁ bhadraṁva vāṇijo.  
  
Self is indeed the lord of self,  
for who else would be one’s lord?  
Self is indeed the home of self,  
so restrain yourself,  
as a merchant his thoroughbred steed.  
  
Pāmojjabahulo bhikkhu,  
pasanno buddhasāsane;  
Adhigacche padaṁ santaṁ,  
saṅkhārūpasamaṁ sukhaṁ.  
  
A monk full of joy  
trusting in the Buddha’s teaching,  
would realize the peaceful state,  
the blissful stilling of conditions.  
  
Yo have daharo bhikkhu,  
yuñjati buddhasāsane;  
Somaṁ lokaṁ pabhāseti,  
abbhā muttova candimā.  
  
A young mendicant  
devoted to the Buddha’s teaching,  
lights up the world,  
like the moon freed from a cloud.  

### 26. Brāhmaṇavagga: Brahmins

Chinda sotaṁ parakkamma,  
kāme panuda brāhmaṇa;  
Saṅkhārānaṁ khayaṁ ñatvā,  
akataññūsi brāhmaṇa.  
  
Strive and cut the stream!  
Dispel sensual pleasures, brahmin.  
Knowing the ending of conditions,  
know the uncreated, brahmin.  
  
Yadā dvayesu dhammesu,  
pāragū hoti brāhmaṇo;  
Athassa sabbe saṁyogā,  
atthaṁ gacchanti jānato.  
  
When a brahmin  
has gone beyond two things,  
then they consciously  
make an end of all fetters.  
  
Yassa pāraṁ apāraṁ vā,  
pārāpāraṁ na vijjati;  
Vītaddaraṁ visaṁyuttaṁ,  
tamahaṁ brūmi brāhmaṇaṁ.  
  
When one does not recognize the near shore,  
the far shore, or both;  
stress-free, detached,  
that’s who I call a brahmin.  
  
Jhāyiṁ virajamāsīnaṁ,  
katakiccamanāsavaṁ;  
Uttamatthamanuppattaṁ,  
tamahaṁ brūmi brāhmaṇaṁ.  
  
Absorbed, rid of hopes,  
their task completed, without defilements,  
arrived at the highest goal:  
that’s who I call a brahmin.  
  
Divā tapati ādicco,  
rattimābhāti candimā;  
Sannaddho khattiyo tapati,  
jhāyī tapati brāhmaṇo;  
Atha sabbamahorattiṁ,  
buddho tapati tejasā.  
  
The sun blazes by day,  
the moon glows at night,  
the aristocrat shines in armor,  
and the brahmin shines in absorption.  
But all day and all night,  
the Buddha shines with glory.  
  
Bāhitapāpoti brāhmaṇo,  
Samacariyā samaṇoti vuccati;  
Pabbājayamattano malaṁ,  
Tasmā “pabbajito”ti vuccati.  
  
A brahmin’s so-called because they have banished evil,  
an ascetic’s so-called since they live a serene life.  
One who has renounced all stains  
is said to be a “renunciant”.  
  
Na brāhmaṇassa pahareyya,  
nāssa muñcetha brāhmaṇo;  
Dhī brāhmaṇassa hantāraṁ,  
tato dhī yassa muñcati.  
  
One should never strike a brahmin,  
nor should a brahmin retaliate.  
Woe to the one who hurts a brahmin,  
and woe for the one who retaliates.  
  
Na brāhmaṇassetadakiñci seyyo,  
Yadā nisedho manaso piyehi;  
Yato yato hiṁsamano nivattati,  
Tato tato sammatimeva dukkhaṁ.  
  
Nothing is better for a brahmin  
than to hold their mind back from attachment.  
As cruelty in the mind gradually subsides,  
suffering also subsides.

by body, speech or mind,

You should graciously honor  
the one from whom you learn the Dhamma  
taught by the awakened Buddha,  
as a brahmin honors the sacred flame.  
  
Na jaṭāhi na gottena,  
na jaccā hoti brāhmaṇo;  
Yamhi saccañca dhammo ca,  
so sucī so ca brāhmaṇo.  
  
Not by matted hair or family,  
or birth is one a brahmin.  
Those who have truth and principle:  
they are pure, they are brahmins.  
  
Kiṁ te jaṭāhi dummedha,  
kiṁ te ajinasāṭiyā;  
Abbhantaraṁ te gahanaṁ,  
bāhiraṁ parimajjasi.  
  
Why the matted hair, you fool,  
and why the skin of deer?  
The tangle is inside you,  
yet you polish up your outsides.

tamahaṁ brūmi brāhmaṇaṁ.  
  
I don’t call someone a brahmin
