Please translate the following verse word by word:

Manopubbaṅgamā dhammā,
manoseṭṭhā manomayā;
Manasā ce paduṭṭhena,
bhāsati vā karoti vā;
Tato naṁ dukkhamanveti,
cakkaṁva vahato padaṁ.

intention is first, they’re made by intention.
If with corrupt intent

ajini maṁ ahāsi me;

They beat me, they robbed me!”  
For those who bear such a grudge,

They beat me, they robbed me!”  
For those who bear no such grudge,

settled by hate,  
it’s only settled by love:  
this is an ancient law.

mayamettha yamāmase;  
Ye ca tattha vijānanti,  
tato sammanti medhagā.  
  
Others don’t understand  
that here we need to be restrained.  
But those who do understand this,  
being clever, settle their conflicts.  
  
Subhānupassiṁ viharantaṁ,  
indriyesu asaṁvutaṁ;

Taṁ ve pasahati māro,  
vāto rukkhaṁva dubbalaṁ.

Apeto damasaccena,  
na so kāsāvamarahati.  
  
One who, not free of stains themselves,  
would wear the robe stained in ocher,  
bereft of self-control and of truth:

sīlesu susamāhito;  
Upeto damasaccena,  
sa ve kāsāvamarahati.

steady in ethics,

Asāre sāramatino,  
sāre cāsāradassino;  
Te sāraṁ nādhigacchanti,  
micchāsaṅkappagocarā.  
  
Thinking the inessential is essential,  
seeing the essential as inessential;  
they don’t realize the essential,  
for wrong thoughts are their pasture.

asārañca asārato;  
Te sāraṁ adhigacchanti,  
sammāsaṅkappagocarā.

and the inessential as inessential;  
they realize the essential,

Yathā agāraṁ ducchannaṁ,  
vuṭṭhī samativijjhati;  
Evaṁ abhāvitaṁ cittaṁ,  
rāgo samativijjhati.  
  
Just as rain seeps into  
a poorly roofed house,  
lust seeps into  
an undeveloped mind.

a well roofed house,

Pāpakārī ubhayattha socati;  
So socati so vihaññati,  
Disvā kammakiliṭṭhamattano.  
  
Here they grieve, hereafter they grieve,  
an evildoer grieves in both places.  
They grieve and fret,  
seeing their own corrupt deeds.  
  
Idha modati pecca modati,  
Katapuñño ubhayattha modati;  
So modati so pamodati,  
Disvā kammavisuddhimattano.

one who does good rejoices in both places.  
They rejoice and celebrate,

Bhiyyo tappati duggatiṁ gato.  
  
Here they’re tormented, hereafter they’re tormented,  
an evildoer is tormented in both places.  
They’re tormented thinking of bad things they’ve done;  
when gone to a bad place, they’re tormented all the more.  
  
Idha nandati pecca nandati,  
Katapuñño ubhayattha nandati;  
“Puññaṁ me katan”ti nandati,  
Bhiyyo nandati suggatiṁ gato.  
  
Here they delight, hereafter they delight,  
one who does good delights in both places.  
They delight thinking of good things they’ve done;

Bahumpi ce saṁhita bhāsamāno,  
Na takkaro hoti naro pamatto;  
Gopova gāvo gaṇayaṁ paresaṁ,  
Na bhāgavā sāmaññassa hoti.  
  
Much though they may recite scripture,  
if a negligent person does not apply them,  
then, like a cowherd who counts the cattle of others,  
they miss out on the blessings of the ascetic life.  
  
Appampi ce saṁhita bhāsamāno,  
Dhammassa hoti anudhammacārī;  
Rāgañca dosañca pahāya mohaṁ,  
Sammappajāno suvimuttacitto;  
Anupādiyāno idha vā huraṁ vā,  
Sa bhāgavā sāmaññassa hoti.  
  
Little though they may recite scripture,  
if they live in line with the teachings,  
having given up greed, hate, and delusion,  
with deep understanding and heart well-freed,  
not grasping to this world or the next,  
they share in the blessings of the ascetic life.  

### 2. Appamādavagga: Diligence

Appamādo amatapadaṁ,  
pamādo maccuno padaṁ;  
Appamattā na mīyanti,  
ye pamattā yathā matā.  
  
Heedfulness is the deathless state;  
heedlessness is the state of death.  
The heedful do not die,  
while the heedless are like the dead.  
  
Evaṁ visesato ñatvā,  
appamādamhi paṇḍitā;  
Appamāde pamodanti,  
ariyānaṁ gocare ratā.  
  
Understanding this distinction  
when it comes to heedfulness,  
the astute rejoice in heedfulness,  
happy in the noble ones’ domain.  
  
Te jhāyino sātatikā,  
niccaṁ daḷhaparakkamā;  
Phusanti dhīrā nibbānaṁ,  
yogakkhemaṁ anuttaraṁ.  
  
They who regularly meditate,  
always staunchly vigorous;  
those wise ones realize quenching,  
the supreme sanctuary.  
  
Uṭṭhānavato satīmato,  
Sucikammassa nisammakārino;  
Saññatassa dhammajīvino,  
Appamattassa yasobhivaḍḍhati.  
  
For the hard-working and mindful,  
pure of deed and attentive,  
restrained, living righteously, and diligent,  
their reputation only grows.  
  
Uṭṭhānenappamādena,  
saṁyamena damena ca;  
Dīpaṁ kayirātha medhāvī,  
yaṁ ogho nābhikīrati.  
  
By hard work and diligence,  
by restraint and by self-control,  
a smart person would build an island  
that the floods cannot overflow.  
  
Pamādamanuyuñjanti,  
bālā dummedhino janā;  
Appamādañca medhāvī,  
dhanaṁ seṭṭhaṁva rakkhati.  
  
Fools and half-wits  
devote themselves to negligence.  
But the wise protect diligence  
as their best treasure.  
  
Mā pamādamanuyuñjetha,  
mā kāmaratisanthavaṁ;  
Appamatto hi jhāyanto,  
pappoti vipulaṁ sukhaṁ.  
  
Don’t devote yourself to negligence,  
or delight in sexual intimacy.  
For if you’re diligent and meditate,  
you’ll attain abundant happiness.  
  
Pamādaṁ appamādena,  
yadā nudati paṇḍito;  
Paññāpāsādamāruyha,  
asoko sokiniṁ pajaṁ;  
Pabbataṭṭhova bhūmaṭṭhe,  
dhīro bāle avekkhati.  
  
When the astute dispel negligence  
by means of diligence,  
ascending the palace of wisdom,  
sorrowless, they behold this generation of sorrow,  
as a wise man on a mountain-top  
beholds the fools below.  
  
Appamatto pamattesu,  
suttesu bahujāgaro;  
Abalassaṁva sīghasso,  
hitvā yāti sumedhaso.  
  
Heedful among the heedless,  
wide awake while others sleep—  
a true sage leaves them behind,  
like a swift horse passing a feeble.  
  
Appamādena maghavā,  
devānaṁ seṭṭhataṁ gato;  
Appamādaṁ pasaṁsanti,  
pamādo garahito sadā.  
  
Maghavā became chief of the gods  
by means of diligence.  
People praise diligence,  
while negligence is always deplored.  
  
Appamādarato bhikkhu,  
pamāde bhayadassi vā;  
Saṁyojanaṁ aṇuṁ thūlaṁ,  
ḍahaṁ aggīva gacchati.  
  
A mendicant who loves to be diligent,  
seeing fear in negligence—  
advances like fire,  
burning up fetters big and small.  
  
Appamādarato bhikkhu,  
pamāde bhayadassi vā;  
Abhabbo parihānāya,  
nibbānasseva santike.  
  
A mendicant who loves to be diligent,  
seeing fear in negligence—  
such a one can’t decline,  
and has drawn near to extinguishment.  

### 3. Cittavagga: The Mind

Phandanaṁ capalaṁ cittaṁ,  
dūrakkhaṁ dunnivārayaṁ;  
Ujuṁ karoti medhāvī,  
usukārova tejanaṁ.  
  
The mind quivers and shakes,  
hard to guard, hard to curb.  
The discerning straighten it out,  
like a fletcher straightens an arrow.  
  
Vārijova thale khitto,  
okamokataubbhato;  
Pariphandatidaṁ cittaṁ,  
māradheyyaṁ pahātave.  
  
Like a fish pulled from the sea  
and cast upon the shore,  
this mind flounders about,  
trying to throw off Māra’s sway.  
  
Dunniggahassa lahuno,  
yatthakāmanipātino;  
Cittassa damatho sādhu,  
cittaṁ dantaṁ sukhāvahaṁ.  
  
Hard to hold back, flighty,  
alighting where it will;  
it’s good to tame the mind;  
a tamed mind leads to bliss.  
  
Sududdasaṁ sunipuṇaṁ,  
yatthakāmanipātinaṁ;  
Cittaṁ rakkhetha medhāvī,  
cittaṁ guttaṁ sukhāvahaṁ.  
  
So hard to see, so subtle,  
alighting where it will;  
the discerning protect the mind,  
a guarded mind leads to bliss.  
  
Dūraṅgamaṁ ekacaraṁ,  
asarīraṁ guhāsayaṁ;  
Ye cittaṁ saṁyamissanti,  
mokkhanti mārabandhanā.  
  
The mind travels far, wandering alone;  
incorporeal, it hides in a cave.  
Those who will restrain the mind  
are freed from Māra’s bonds.  
  
Anavaṭṭhitacittassa,  
saddhammaṁ avijānato;  
Pariplavapasādassa,  
paññā na paripūrati.  
  
Those of unsteady mind,  
who don’t understand the true teaching,  
and whose confidence wavers,  
do not perfect their wisdom.  
  
Anavassutacittassa,  
ananvāhatacetaso;  
Puññapāpapahīnassa,  
natthi jāgarato bhayaṁ.  
  
One whose mind is uncorrupted,  
whose heart is undamaged,  
who’s given up right and wrong,  
alert, has nothing to fear.  
  
Kumbhūpamaṁ kāyamimaṁ viditvā,  
Nagarūpamaṁ cittamidaṁ ṭhapetvā;  
Yodhetha māraṁ paññāvudhena,  
Jitañca rakkhe anivesano siyā.  
  
Knowing this body breaks like a pot,  
and fortifying the mind like a citadel,  
attack Māra with the sword of wisdom,  
guard your conquest, and never settle.  
  
Aciraṁ vatayaṁ kāyo,  
pathaviṁ adhisessati;  
Chuddho apetaviññāṇo,  
niratthaṁva kaliṅgaraṁ.  
  
All too soon this body  
will lie upon the earth,  
bereft of consciousness,  
tossed aside like a useless log.  
  
Diso disaṁ yaṁ taṁ kayirā,  
verī vā pana verinaṁ;  
Micchāpaṇihitaṁ cittaṁ,  
pāpiyo naṁ tato kare.  
  
A wrongly directed mind  
would do you more harm  
than a hater to the hated,  
or an enemy to their foe.  
  
Na taṁ mātā pitā kayirā,  
aññe vāpi ca ñātakā;  
Sammāpaṇihitaṁ cittaṁ,  
seyyaso naṁ tato kare.  
  
A rightly directed mind  
would do you more good  
than your mother or father  
or any other relative.  

### 4. Pupphavagga: Flowers

Ko imaṁ pathaviṁ vicessati,  
Yamalokañca imaṁ sadevakaṁ;  
Ko dhammapadaṁ sudesitaṁ,  
Kusalo pupphamiva pacessati.  
  
Who shall explore this land,  
and the Yama realm with its gods?  
Who shall examine the well-taught word of truth,  
as an expert examines a flower?  
  
Sekho pathaviṁ vicessati,  
Yamalokañca imaṁ sadevakaṁ;  
Sekho dhammapadaṁ sudesitaṁ,  
Kusalo pupphamiva pacessati.  
  
A trainee shall explore this land,  
and the Yama realm with its gods.  
A trainee shall examine the well-taught word of truth,  
as an expert examines a flower.  
  
Pheṇūpamaṁ kāyamimaṁ viditvā,  
Marīcidhammaṁ abhisambudhāno;  
Chetvāna mārassa papupphakāni,  
Adassanaṁ maccurājassa gacche.  
  
Knowing this body’s like foam,  
realizing it’s all just a mirage,  
and cutting off Māra’s blossoming,  
vanish from the King of Death.  
  
Pupphāni heva pacinantaṁ,  
byāsattamanasaṁ naraṁ;  
Suttaṁ gāmaṁ mahoghova,  
maccu ādāya gacchati.  
  
As a mighty flood sweeps off a sleeping village,  
death steals away a man  
even as he gathers flowers,  
his mind caught up in them.  
  
Pupphāni heva pacinantaṁ,  
byāsattamanasaṁ naraṁ;  
Atittaññeva kāmesu,  
antako kurute vasaṁ.  
  
The terminator gains control of the man  
who has not had his fill of pleasures,  
even as he gathers flowers,  
his mind caught up in them.  
  
Yathāpi bhamaro pupphaṁ,  
vaṇṇagandhamaheṭhayaṁ;  
Paleti rasamādāya,  
evaṁ gāme munī care.  
  
A bee takes the nectar  
and moves on, doing no damage  
to the flower’s beauty and fragrance;  
and that’s how a sage should walk in the village.  
  
Na paresaṁ vilomāni,  
na paresaṁ katākataṁ;  
Attanova avekkheyya,  
katāni akatāni ca.  
  
Don’t find fault with others,  
with what they’ve done or left undone.  
You should only watch yourself,  
what you’ve done or left undone.  
  
Yathāpi ruciraṁ pupphaṁ,  
vaṇṇavantaṁ agandhakaṁ;  
Evaṁ subhāsitā vācā,  
aphalā hoti akubbato.  
  
Just like a glorious flower  
that’s colorful but lacks fragrance;  
eloquent speech is fruitless  
for one who does not act on it.  
  
Yathāpi ruciraṁ pupphaṁ,  
Vaṇṇavantaṁ sagandhakaṁ;  
Evaṁ subhāsitā vācā,  
Saphalā hoti kubbato.  
  
Just like a glorious flower  
that’s both colorful and fragrant,  
eloquent speech is fruitful  
for one who acts on it.  
  
Yathāpi puppharāsimhā,  
kayirā mālāguṇe bahū;  
Evaṁ jātena maccena,  
kattabbaṁ kusalaṁ bahuṁ.  
  
Just as one would create many garlands  
from a heap of flowers,  
when a person has come to be born,  
they should do many skillful things.  
  
Na pupphagandho paṭivātameti,  
Na candanaṁ tagaramallikā vā;  
Satañca gandho paṭivātameti,  
Sabbā disā sappuriso pavāyati.  
  
The fragrance of flowers doesn’t spread upwind,  
nor sandalwood, pinwheel, or jasmine;  
but the fragrance of the good spreads upwind;  
a good person’s virtue spreads in every direction.  
  
Candanaṁ tagaraṁ vāpi,  
uppalaṁ atha vassikī;  
Etesaṁ gandhajātānaṁ,  
sīlagandho anuttaro.  
  
Among all the fragrances—  
sandalwood or pinwheel  
or lotus or jasmine—  
the fragrance of virtue is supreme.  
  
Appamatto ayaṁ gandho,  
yāyaṁ tagaracandanī;  
Yo ca sīlavataṁ gandho,  
vāti devesu uttamo.  
  
Faint is the fragrance  
of sandal or pinwheel;  
but the fragrance of the virtuous  
floats to the highest gods.  
  
Tesaṁ sampannasīlānaṁ,  
appamādavihārinaṁ;  
Sammadaññāvimuttānaṁ,  
māro maggaṁ na vindati.  
  
For those accomplished in ethics,  
meditating diligently,  
freed through the highest knowledge,  
Māra cannot find their path.  
  
Yathā saṅkāradhānasmiṁ,  
ujjhitasmiṁ mahāpathe;  
Padumaṁ tattha jāyetha,  
sucigandhaṁ manoramaṁ.  
  
From a forsaken heap  
discarded on the highway,  
a lotus might blossom,  
fragrant and delightful.  
  
Evaṁ saṅkārabhūtesu,  
andhabhūte puthujjane;  
Atirocati paññāya,  
sammāsambuddhasāvako.  
  
So too, among the forsaken,  
a disciple of the perfect Buddha  
outshines with their wisdom  
the blind ordinary folk.  

### 5. Bālavagga: The Fool

Dīghā jāgarato ratti,  
dīghaṁ santassa yojanaṁ;  
Dīgho bālāna saṁsāro,  
saddhammaṁ avijānataṁ.  
  
Long is the night for the wakeful;  
long is the league for the weary;  
long transmigrate the fools  
who don’t understand the true teaching.  
  
Carañce nādhigaccheyya,  
Seyyaṁ sadisamattano;  
Ekacariyaṁ daḷhaṁ kayirā,  
Natthi bāle sahāyatā.  
  
If while wandering you find no partner  
equal or better than yourself,  
then firmly resolve to wander alone—  
there’s no fellowship with fools.  
  
Puttā matthi dhanaṁ matthi,  
iti bālo vihaññati;  
Attā hi attano natthi,  
kuto puttā kuto dhanaṁ.  
  
“Sons are mine, wealth is mine”—  
thus the fool frets.  
But you can’t even call your self your own,  
let alone your sons or wealth.  
  
Yo bālo maññati bālyaṁ,  
paṇḍito vāpi tena so;  
Bālo ca paṇḍitamānī,  
sa ve “bālo”ti vuccati.  
  
The fool who thinks they’re a fool  
is wise at least to that extent.  
But the true fool is said to be one  
who imagines that they are wise.  
  
Yāvajīvampi ce bālo,  
paṇḍitaṁ payirupāsati;  
Na so dhammaṁ vijānāti,  
dabbī sūparasaṁ yathā.  
  
Though a fool attends to the wise  
even for the rest of their life,  
they still don’t experience the teaching,  
like a spoon the taste of the soup.  
  
Muhuttamapi ce viññū,  
paṇḍitaṁ payirupāsati;  
Khippaṁ dhammaṁ vijānāti,  
jivhā sūparasaṁ yathā.  
  
If a clever person attends to the wise  
even just for an hour or so,  
they swiftly experience the teaching,  
like a tongue the taste of the soup.  
  
Caranti bālā dummedhā,  
amitteneva attanā;  
Karontā pāpakaṁ kammaṁ,  
yaṁ hoti kaṭukapphalaṁ.  
  
Witless fools behave  
like their own worst enemies,  
doing wicked deeds  
that ripen as bitter fruit.  
  
Na taṁ kammaṁ kataṁ sādhu,  
yaṁ katvā anutappati;  
Yassa assumukho rodaṁ,  
vipākaṁ paṭisevati.  
  
It’s not good to do a deed  
that plagues you later on,  
for which you weep and wail,  
as its effect stays with you.  
  
Tañca kammaṁ kataṁ sādhu,  
yaṁ katvā nānutappati;  
Yassa patīto sumano,  
vipākaṁ paṭisevati.  
  
It is good to do a deed  
that doesn’t plague you later on,  
that gladdens and cheers,  
as its effect stays with you.  
  
Madhuṁvā maññati bālo,  
yāva pāpaṁ na paccati;  
Yadā ca paccati pāpaṁ,  
atha dukkhaṁ nigacchati.  
  
The fool imagines that evil is sweet,  
so long as it has not yet ripened.  
But as soon as that evil ripens,  
they fall into suffering.  
  
Māse māse kusaggena,  
bālo bhuñjeyya bhojanaṁ;  
Na so saṅkhātadhammānaṁ,  
kalaṁ agghati soḷasiṁ.  
  
Month after month a fool may eat  
food from a grass-blade’s tip;  
but they’ll never be worth a sixteenth part  
of one who has fathomed the teaching.  
  
Na hi pāpaṁ kataṁ kammaṁ,  
Sajjukhīraṁva muccati;  
Ḍahantaṁ bālamanveti,  
Bhasmacchannova pāvako.  
  
For a wicked deed that has been done  
does not spoil quickly like milk.  
Smoldering, it follows the fool,  
like a fire smothered over with ash.  
  
Yāvadeva anatthāya,  
ñattaṁ bālassa jāyati;  
Hanti bālassa sukkaṁsaṁ,  
muddhamassa vipātayaṁ.  
  
Whatever fame a fool may get,  
it only gives rise to harm.  
Whatever good features they have it ruins,  
and blows their head into bits.  
  
Asantaṁ bhāvanamiccheyya,  
Purekkhārañca bhikkhusu;  
Āvāsesu ca issariyaṁ,  
Pūjaṁ parakulesu ca.  
  
They’d seek the esteem that they lack,  
and status among the mendicants;  
authority over monasteries,  
and honor among other families.  
  
Mameva kata maññantu,  
gihī pabbajitā ubho;  
Mamevātivasā assu,  
kiccākiccesu kismici;  
Iti bālassa saṅkappo,  
icchā māno ca vaḍḍhati.  
  
“Let both layfolk and renunciants think  
the work was done by me alone.  
In anything at all that’s to be done,  
let them fall under my sway alone.”  
So thinks the fool,  
their greed and pride only growing.  
  
Aññā hi lābhūpanisā,  
aññā nibbānagāminī;  
Evametaṁ abhiññāya,  
bhikkhu buddhassa sāvako;  
Sakkāraṁ nābhinandeyya,  
vivekamanubrūhaye.  
  
For the means to profit and the path to quenching  
are two quite different things.  
A mendicant disciple of the Buddha,  
understanding what this really means,  
would never delight in honors,  
but rather would foster seclusion.  

### 6. Paṇḍitavagga: The Astute

Nidhīnaṁva pavattāraṁ,  
yaṁ passe vajjadassinaṁ;  
Niggayhavādiṁ medhāviṁ,  
tādisaṁ paṇḍitaṁ bhaje;  
Tādisaṁ bhajamānassa,  
seyyo hoti na pāpiyo.  
  
Regard one who sees your faults  
as a guide to a hidden treasure.  
Stay close to one so wise and astute  
who corrects you when you need it.  
Sticking close to such an impartial person,  
things get better, not worse.  
  
Ovadeyyānusāseyya,  
asabbhā ca nivāraye;  
Satañhi so piyo hoti,  
asataṁ hoti appiyo.  
  
Advise and instruct;  
curb wickedness:  
for you shall be loved by the good,  
and disliked by the bad.  
  
Na bhaje pāpake mitte,  
na bhaje purisādhame;  
Bhajetha mitte kalyāṇe,  
bhajetha purisuttame.  
  
Don’t mix with bad friends,  
nor with the worst of men.  
Mix with spiritual friends,  
and with the best of men.  
  
Dhammapīti sukhaṁ seti,  
vippasannena cetasā;  
Ariyappavedite dhamme,  
sadā ramati paṇḍito.  
  
Through joy in the teaching you sleep at ease,  
with clear and confident heart.  
An astute person always delights in the teaching  
proclaimed by the Noble One.  
  
Udakañhi nayanti nettikā,  
Usukārā namayanti tejanaṁ;  
Dāruṁ namayanti tacchakā,  
Attānaṁ damayanti paṇḍitā.  
  
While irrigators guide water,  
fletchers straighten arrows,  
and carpenters carve timber,  
the astute tame themselves.  
  
Selo yathā ekaghano,  
vātena na samīrati;  
Evaṁ nindāpasaṁsāsu,  
na samiñjanti paṇḍitā.  
  
As the wind cannot stir  
a solid mass of rock,  
so too praise and blame  
do not affect the wise.  
  
Yathāpi rahado gambhīro,  
vippasanno anāvilo;  
Evaṁ dhammāni sutvāna,  
vippasīdanti paṇḍitā.  
  
Like a deep lake,  
clear and unclouded,  
so clear are the astute  
when they hear the teachings.  
  
Sabbattha ve sappurisā cajanti,  
Na kāmakāmā lapayanti santo;  
Sukhena phuṭṭhā atha vā dukhena,  
Na uccāvacaṁ paṇḍitā dassayanti.  
  
Good people give up everything,  
they don’t cajole for the things they desire.  
Though touched by sadness or happiness,  
the astute appear neither depressed nor elated.  
  
Na attahetu na parassa hetu,  
Na puttamicche na dhanaṁ na raṭṭhaṁ;  
Na iccheyya adhammena samiddhimattano,  
Sa sīlavā paññavā dhammiko siyā.  
  
Never wish for success by unjust means,  
for your own sake or that of another,  
desiring children, wealth, or nation;  
rather, be virtuous, wise, and just.  
  
Appakā te manussesu,  
ye janā pāragāmino;  
Athāyaṁ itarā pajā,  
tīramevānudhāvati.  
  
Few are those among humans  
who cross to the far shore.  
The rest just run around  
on the near shore.  
  
Ye ca kho sammadakkhāte,  
dhamme dhammānuvattino;  
Te janā pāramessanti,  
maccudheyyaṁ suduttaraṁ.  
  
When the teaching is well explained,  
those who practice accordingly  
will cross over  
Death’s domain so hard to pass.  
  
Kaṇhaṁ dhammaṁ vippahāya,  
Sukkaṁ bhāvetha paṇḍito;  
Okā anokamāgamma,  
Viveke yattha dūramaṁ.  
  
Rid of dark qualities,  
an astute person should develop the bright.  
Leaving home behind  
for the seclusion so hard to enjoy,  
  
Tatrābhiratimiccheyya,  
hitvā kāme akiñcano;  
Pariyodapeyya attānaṁ,  
cittaklesehi paṇḍito.  
  
find delight there,  
having left behind sensual pleasures.  
With no possessions, an astute person  
would cleanse themselves of mental corruptions.  
  
Yesaṁ sambodhiyaṅgesu,  
sammā cittaṁ subhāvitaṁ;  
Ādānapaṭinissagge,  
anupādāya ye ratā;  
Khīṇāsavā jutimanto,  
te loke parinibbutā.  
  
Those whose minds are rightly developed  
in the awakening factors;  
who, letting go of attachments,  
delight in not grasping:  
with defilements ended, brilliant,  
they in this world are quenched.
